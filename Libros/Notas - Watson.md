### Capitulo 1 Burn Down the Internet: Why the Online Left is Failing 

```ad-note

This is in part as each one of these related yet idiosyncratic thinkers understood the horror of World War Two as somehow linked to the historical process of reification (the making into an object) of social and cultural relations in line with the tendency of capitalism to subjugate nature and humanity to the numerical count (and therefore to profit). Each saw this as a result of the project of the Enlightenment gone awry and suggested remedies by way of, respectively: artistic abstraction (Adorno); the association of constellations of objects and occurrences with which to interpret capitalism (Benjamin); a return to philosophizing (Horkheimer), and a freeing of eros via artistic expression (Marcuse). 

pp. 11

Se relaciona un poco con lo de Wisecrack del club de la pelea de que todo debe de tener un proposito y al final es imposible escapar del capitalismo, pues de todo necesitas ser bueno u obtener un beneficio.

Above all, this book addresses the central idea of Capitalist Realism, choosing to return throughout to that one book of Fisher’s, in part as it parallels so closely the Frankfurt School, in part as it has become an iconic meme. That central idea is that capitalism is responsible for mental illness, especially depression. We can see this today in light of the covid lockdowns that have disproportionately affected poor people who are already subject to mental health problems due to environmental, work, and dietary factors. Though, moreover, we see it in a collective stasis brought about by the lockdown in a physical sense, but going far beyond the lockdown itself. It is a kind of sickness of society: the psycho-sociological parallel to years — decades, even — of a depressive economic malaise affecting everyone from the middle class down (and even trapping the elite in the inertia of capital, as everyone is
ultimately beholden to the data economy). 

pp.12

```

Capitalismo realimo es la incapacidad para pensar fuera de la capacidad del capitalismo.

Es muy claro ver esto, yo lo he visto en Instagram, siempre que alguein habla o critica al mismo, sale el bato que te contesta: "Entonces vete", como si esa respuesta produjera más solución.

Lo que se relaciona un poco con Byun Chul Han, al ser nosotros mismos lo que perpetuamos esta economía.

Namely, that the left matches the right’s claim that America be made great again through a focus on individual grit by emphasizing the individual role we can all play in fostering a society managed for the benefit of the many, not the few. This would rise to the challenge of building a sense of purpose for the left that meets the heroic narrative of the right, predicated on the idea of dispelling enemy hordes and individually embodying the fate of the nation or race. Against this, what could
be more heroic and necessary than having an individual role in creating the first society that is truly open to races and nations, while giving an opportunity for all to develop their talents through gainful employment? Sanders and Corbyn could even have doubled down on the idea of a bogeyman in the form of the super-rich, or the 1 per cent, as both Sanders and Corbyn did to some degree. 
Yet, however compelling the left narrative of a class of underdogs rising up, deposing their overlords, and founding the fairest society known to humankind is, it perennially fails to gain electoral votes.

Bernie debió de apelar a un mencanismo distinto para ganerle a Trump. Como se mencion más adelante, en lugar buscar imitar sus protesta o apelar la voluntad individual debio apelar a la reflexión lenta.

The meme production of the Yang Gang is just one incarnation of “shitposting,” which is essentially the practice of producing lo-fi montage images to deliberately disparage or undermine a cause. The tendency in itself has become more of an aesthetic than a political tactic, inspiring a descent into a trash visual culture whereby jokey, low resolution, and glitched productions are seen as inherently more valuable than the serious and polished output of the mainstream media. 

pp.15

```

El uso del shitposting como una practica política para desprestigiar un movimieto ha deja de ser una tactica politica para convertirse en una estetica.

La apropiación de simbolos debe de hacerse con cuidado para evitar confusiones.

```ad-note

Seen in this way the already sizable online left is no different to the bigger community of mostly female selfie producers who upload daily videos and pictures on TikTok and Instagram to generate attention and sponsorships for themselves, and clicks for the social media giants. Ultimately, internet corporations don’t care what you do, so long as you give them data — and the online left is simply one niche identity that achieves this. For young women uploading selfies, the internet plays on their insecurity at their own appearance. For young leftist meme producers of a similar age, social media companies play on threats made to their identity by right-wing imagery, or by leftists of other factions. None of this builds a coherent left-of-center movement, even if there is a growing communist, socialist, and anarchist presence online.

The lack of coherence within the online left is hardly surprising, given that the owners and shareholders of online social media apps, search engines, and shopping platforms are among the most powerful capitalists of all time. Indeed, we have to assume that the proliferation of online left content on major platforms such as YouTube and the streaming site Twitch is possible precisely because it is conducive to capitalism, a point that fits squarely within Mark Fisher’s observations in Capitalist Realism regarding the tendency of capitalism to incorporate and blunt the teeth of alternative movements.

pp. 15

```

La izquierda carece de un identidad fuerte en redes, a diferencia de la derecha que tien unos simbolos definidos.

Al internet dirigido por grandes compañias no le interesa que se forme una izquierda fuerte, le beneficia. Al final todo lo que no sea izquierda es algo que al final se integrará en el Capitalismo, según Fisher.

```ad-note

The left internet has unfortunately become one assembly line in a vast factory of irritation in which the principal production unit is contrarianism, as seen in the above examples: You think you’re this (a never Trumper) but I’ll sell you this (MAGA hat); you think I represent this (QAnon), but actually, I’m this (anti-QAnon with QAnon characteristics); we are aiming at this (left communitarianism), but really we only achieve this (further division). And yet we still ask why the left is failing.

It barely needs saying that if we are to use the internet to build a movement that will challenge the hegemony of major corporations we need to rewire it toward education, organization, and reflection. And to achieve this, we need memes that challenge the breakneck speed that platforms encourage us to browse at. It is for this reason I propose a “slow meme” movement that encourages use of the internet’s great resources in a considered way that challenges the data economy while building a community that can also function and meet offline. 

pp. 17

```

Para contrarrestar el avance tan rápido y con simbolos ya consolidados de la derecha, la izquierda debe usar "el meme lento". Un meme que en lugar de ser de fácil consumo es un meme que busca una reflexión.

&nbsp

```ad-note

In forging a new path, we have much to learn from historical absurdist and abstract movements such as Dada, Surrealism, Fluxus, Cubism, and Abstract Expressionism, that while facing down heinous right-wing and industrialist capitalist movements, sought
answers in reflective works appealing to the subconscious or to some nonsensical abstract language that resisted the rationalist and capitalist injunction to produce ever more stuff, ever quicker. The efficacy of such movements can be seen in attempts to stifle them by totalitarian regimes or in the US government’s efforts to co-opt abstraction in the 1950s and 1960s, despite Pollock’s communism. 

pp. 17

```

La izquierda contemporanea tiene que aprender de movimientos como el Dada, y Fluxus que lucharon contra el orden capitalista y movimientos afines.

While this will rightly be seen as indicative of a brazenly benign strategy of undermining truth and encouraging QAnon fantasy on the part of the Republican elite, led by Trump, there is a more profound long-term trend underlying the events of January 6. Simply, the increasingly horizontalized diffusion of culture, giving people unprecedented access to images, texts, movies, music, and code, which they can enjoy, reconfigure, parody, and appropriate in their own social media publications (as “content”), has left a great expectancy. Everyone feels they now have the right to consume and relate information and anyone can be an arbiter of “truth.” Yet this has led to less, not more, truth, as the only thing that matters is the growth of data and of profit margins for a class of data owners and finance speculators. 

pp. 18

```

Lo anterior responde a esa sensación de que al vivir en un cultura horizontal podemos tener acceso a imagenes y videos y producir "contenido" para compartir con nuestros conocidos al final lo que importa es la producción.

Es como la ira rápida del "Joker", la solucion es salir a las calles a destruir cosas y dispararle a la gente que no te gusta como te trata.

#### Conclusión Capitulo 1

La izquierdda debe de un usar un enfoque más pensado y lento que apele a la reflexión sobre el entorno a travpes del meme. Es erroneo intentar imitar el actuar de consumo rapido y de simbolos definidos de la extrema derecha. El hacer lo anterior, confunde a las personas.

La derecha debe optar por el actuar de movimientos como el Dada o Fluxus.

### Capítulo 2 The Work of Art in the Age of the Subscription Economy

```ad-note

The works of this loose grouping of thinkers (among them Theodor Adorno, Walter
Benjamin, Erich Fromm, Max Horkheimer, Leo Löwenthal, Herbert Marcuse, Friedrich Pollock), active in the inter and post-war period, have become a staple of cultural theory in the West over the last 3 decades. Perhaps its most famed text, Benjamin’s The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction (1935), is worth revisiting not least as it relates so closely to the cultural and political situation we currently live in.

pp. 18

```

Libro: _The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction (1935)_

La escuela de Frankfurt se menciona aquí como un escuela que puso al centro de su teoria a la persona.

&nbsp

```ad-note

Benjamin argued that the offer of “culture for all” can prove disastrous where there is no coincident shift in material relations. Such a
situation can lead ultimately to a frustrated population, open to exploitation by essentially right-wing populists (or in Benjamin’s era
the fascists who at the time governed over Italy and Germany, with Spain shortly to follow).

pp. 18

```

Walter Banjamin alegó la necesidad de que las personas de todas clases pudieran tener un experiencia estetica, aunuque la reproducciones perderían su "aura".

&nbsp

```ad-note

Of course, this has resonances with the way in which billions of people find themselves today to be protagonists of moving and still image media such as YouTube, Twitch, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, Twitter, and so on...These platforms offer the possibility — however remote — of an instant rise to fame, as well as potential access to seemingly boundless material wealth. Though the possibility that anyone might become famous or rich by no means suggests that everyone will, and the stakes inevitably leave many people disappointed. 

pp.18

```

Podríamos relacionar el culto a la imágen con la aparicón de los influencer y la fama instantanea en internet. Al final es una ilusión a menos que tengas el suficiente público.

   Nota: Mientras leía el parrafo sobre Twitch en la página 19, literalmente tenía de fondo a un streamer coreana, Tyongeee. Todo esta a las 9:31 pm del día 8 de Noviembre de 2021.

Podría relacionarse con el clip de José Ortuno sobre la invasión zombie, donde al final se ven los zombies reflejados en la pantalla.

&nbsp

```ad-note

While many such platforms exist, it will suffice here to focus on the streaming platform “Twitch” and the subscription content service “Patreon.” Twitch — which grew exponentially during covid lockdown as a streaming site in general but also as a site for left-wing streamers — was established in 2011 as a spinoff of the internet TV streaming service Justin.tv, and was developed for the live streaming of video gaming. Within 3 years Twitch gained around 50 million users prompting Justin.tv to close its services, as its owners focused on the niche video streaming market, which soon became hugely popular while attracting other niche streaming markets. 

[...]

Patreon, on the other hand, began in 2013 as its founder, musician Jack Conte, sought a solution to the problem that many musicians face: how to monetize their huge online popularity in an era in which listeners are habituated to streaming and downloading for free. Since then it has become a global provider of “membership businesses” for creative practitioners. The model allows people to set monthly subscription rates in return for exclusive artworks, essays, videos, songs, etc., and is used by podcasters, independent publishers, Twitch, and YouTube content producers as a valuable source of supplemental income. As we approach the uncertainty of the post-covid era with inevitable cuts to cultural funding in many regions, such a model may help redefine cultural capital, and “culture” itself.

pp. 19

```

```ad-note

Though this event itself was not monetized, the creation of such independent online “happenings” alongside the potential for funding from sources such as Patreon and Twitch signals the possibility that artists might simply break free from the art market altogether. To some degree, the promise of riches and independence offered to the public via mass image reproduction in the 1930s is coming to fruition with an unprecedented level of freedom and financial independence offered to creative practitioners, as well as to gamers, meme producers, authors, and amateur models. 

pp.20

```

Sobre Twitch y Patreon, como una manera de escapar de las cadenas de los medios capitalistas. Al ser un espacio en el que la masa esta en contacto con la academía y las reglas de las artes superiores su bien no es que no se sigan son subertidas.

&nbsp

```ad-note

While bearing this in mind it should be considered that such platforms do little in themselves to challenge Benjamin’s hypothesis as set out in The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction. Indeed, the notion that an increased public appetite for wealth and power led by new mediatic forms will lead to the political class diverting the public’s attention through populist rhetoric appears to be borne out in very recent history. Bolsonaro, Trump, and Johnson are all clear examples of politicians who came to power by offering “the people” the voice that the public has by now come to believe it deserves, while all the time working against its interests. Each of their movements has appealed to the notion that the public is ready to override the advice of experts, a point made possible as new mediatic forms have increased the individuals’ desire to circumvent power structures and gatekeepers to celebrity. Where pre-existing media structures aimed to allow fame to only the chosen few, it is now even possible to become accidentally famous. In this climate, how do you explain to people that they are not worthy of attention and success? Or that their opinions are secondary to those of “experts” or career politicians?

pp.20

```

Bolsonar y Trump son unos vende humo. Quieren darle a la gente el poder de habla que se merecen aunque claramente trabajan contra los intereses de la misma.

&nbsp

```ad-note

Such a description in many ways fits into dreams of the early internet, which came into wide use 20 years after Attali published Noise: The Political Economy of Music, giving it an almost prophetic status. The early net was, however, subject to ncreasing expropriation by corporations, the largest among them being Google, Facebook, and Amazon. The extent to which independent initiatives can exist alongside these ompanies is open to debate and we must face the contradiction that neither Patreon nor Twitch would have the visibility without Google, and that Amazon bought the latter platform as far back as 2014. 

pp. 21

```

Pero cual es el impacto real que tienen estas plataformas comparado con los verdaderos reyes del Internet: ¿Google, Facebook, Amazon? Al final las grandes compañias evitan que la clase baja tenga el voz que de verdad busca o el impacto deseado.

Todos nuestro actuar en estas plataformas al final es un click para el poder capitalista.

&nbsp

```ad-note

Though this situation may becomesuperseded, as a number of both male and female Twitch streamers, including “Amouranth,” “Justaminx,” and “Asian Andy,” have begun monetizing their sleep, by streaming themselves catching some Zzzzs as their audience looks on, occasionally tipping them (Asian Andy having earned $16,000 in one night’s sleep in February 2021). This might act as something of a warning to us all: in future, capitalism will profit not only from our every waking hour, but our every sleeping hour too. For anyone startled by the unnaturalness of all this, it may be worth taking a step back, going offline a couple of days and nights a week, and taking some time to read some media critique. Yet in so doing, be sure to note the tools we now have at our disposal for self-expression, congregation (at least online), and self-education. For there is a very real sense in which every loss that has been made by the worker and the left since the 1930s is accompanied by a gain. Are we being watched by the apps and devices we use? Yes, but so are our politicians, leading to greater transparency. Are we subject to a constant bombardment of images and information? Yes, but we can also all make and disseminate info and images constantly. Are we constantly making money for the capitalist system? Yes, but we have the tools to monetize our own creative output like never before. The list of simultaneous gains and losses goes on and on. The main thing to hold on to is the fact that the relative accessibility of media, both to users and producers, remains as crucial to the political arena today as in the 1930s. It is up to us to leverage the freedom (however little, however much) we have within the capitalist whole to prevent the slide into tyranny that Benjamin witnessed.

Es una paradoja que las mismas armas que sirven para la libertad de expresión mas libre sena las misma que se usan contra nosotros. Como habla en el primer capítulo, el acceso horizontal a las imágenes y videos  es clave en nuestra época.

#### Conclusión Capitulo 2

Es posible usar als marmas del capitalismo en su contra. El ejmplo de _Patreon_ y _Twitch_ como un medio de expresión fuera de la cademia y el mercado de arte es claro. 

Aunque lo anterior no significa que las elites esten alentando la expresión, aún el Internet es controlado por las grandes corporaciones capitalsitas y cadad click beneficia al capitalismo.

### Capítulo 3 Adorno and Horkheimer: Elements of QAnon
