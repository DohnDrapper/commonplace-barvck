When Hiroshima was destroyed by an atomic bomb in 1945, it is said, the first living thing to emerge from the blasted landscape was a matsutake mushroom.3

### Capítulo 1 "Art of noticing" "Arte de darte cuenta"

```ad-note

Job advocates imagined only wage contracts for healthy white men; the
foragers—disabled white veterans, Asian refugees, Native Americans,
and undocumented Latinos—were invisible interlopers. Conservation-
ists were fighting to keep human disturbance out of the forests; the
entry of thousands of people, had it been noticed, would hardly have
been welcome. But the mushroom hunters were mainly not noticed. At

pág.18
```

El cultivo de hongos resulto en una alternativa de empleo par aaquellos que no tenia un contrato remunerado, en medio de la batallaentre medio ambiente y condiciones de trabajo.

```ad-note

A few years into the new century, the idea of a trade-off between 
jobs and the environment seemed less convincing. With or without
conservation, there were fewer “jobs” in the twentieth-century sense in
the United States; besides, it seemed much more likely that environ-
mental damage would kill all of us off, jobs or no jobs. We are stuck
with the problem of living despite economic and ecological ruination.
Neither tales of progress nor of ruin tell us how to think about collabo-
rative survival. It is time to pay attention to mushroom picking. Not
that this will save us—but it might open our imaginations.

pág.18

```

El ambiente debe estar contemplado en nuestro palens para el futuro, pues si no existe no tendremso de donde mantanernos. La utora habal de como los hogos resultaron un medo de vida para lo inmigrantes que pasaban inadvertidos para los demás.

```ad-note

Precarity is the condition of being vulnerable to others. Unpredict-
able encounters transform us; we are not in control, even of ourselves.
Unable to rely on a stable structure of community, we are thrown into
shifting assemblages, which remake us as well as our others. We can’t
rely on the status quo; everything is in flux, including our ability to sur-
vive. Thinking through precarity changes social analysis. A precarious
world is a world without teleology. Indeterminacy, the unplanned na-
ture of time, is frightening, but thinking through precarity makes it
evident that indeterminacy also makes life possible.

pág.20

```

El mundo en el que vivimo maás que encntrarse en abundania se ahalla en un estado de precariedad, es decir, estamos vulnerables. UNa idea que no exploramo del todo. Pero que peude resonar en como la gente esta renunciando a sus trabajo y no buscando uno. Pues als condidicones en eque viven son precarias. Creoq ue puede relacionarse igual con esa idea de el "1%" mientras los demás apenas vivimos en muchos casos.

```ad-note

The only reason all this sounds odd is that most of us were raised on
dreams of modernization and progress. These frames sort out those
parts of the present that might lead to the future. The rest are trivial;
they “drop out” of history. I imagine you talking back: “Progress? That’s
an idea from the nineteenth century.” The term “progress,” referring to
a general state, has become rare; even twentieth-century modernization
has begun to feel archaic. But their categories and assumptions of im-
provement are with us everywhere. We imagine their objects every day:
democracy, growth, science, hope. Why would we expect economies to
grow and sciences to advance? Even without explicit reference to devel-
opment, our theories of history are embroiled in these categories. So,
too, are our personal dreams. I’ll admit it’s hard for me to even say this:
there might not be a collective happy ending. Then why bother getting
up in the morning?

pág. 20 y 21

```

El avance tecnologico es loq ue definido al historia de la humanidad y tenemos interiorizado el concepto de siempre ir hacia delante.

```ad-note

Progress is embedded, too, in widely accepted assumptions about
what it means to be human. Even when disguised through other terms,
such as “agency,” “consciousness,” and “intention,” we learn over and
over that humans are different from the rest of the living world because
we look forward—while other species, which live day to day, are thus
dependent on us. As long as we imagine that humans are made through
progress, nonhumans are stuck within this imaginative framework too.


pág. 21
```

El concepto de progresoe s creado y dicta la manera en que vemos el mundo. Cuando se habla de progreso se habla de _humanidad_ no se habla de als demas especies y de como se ven afectadas.

```ad-note

Patterns of unintentional coordination develop in assemblages. To
notice such patterns means watching the interplay of temporal rhythms
and scales in the divergent lifeways that gather. Surprisingly, this turns
out to be a method that might revitalize political economy as well as
environmental studies. Assemblages drag political economy inside them,
and not just for humans. Plantation crops have lives different from
those of their free-living siblings; cart horses and hunter steeds share
species but not lifeways. Assemblages cannot hide from capital and the
state; they are sites for watching how political economy works. If capi-
talism has no teleology, we need to see what comes together—not just
by prefabrication, but also by juxtaposition.

## Capítulo 2 "Contamianción como colaboración"

```ad-note

The assumption of self-containment made an explosion of new knowl-
edge possible. Thinking through self-containment and thus the self--
interest of individuals (at whatever scale) made it possible to ignore con-
tamination, that is, transformation through encounter. Self-contained
individuals are not transformed by encounter. Maximizing their inter-
ests, they use encounters—but remain unchanged in them. Noticing is
unnecessary to track these unchanging individuals. A “standard” indi-
vidual can stand in for all as a unit of analysis. It becomes possible to
organize knowledge through logic alone. Without the possibility of
transformative encounters, mathematics can replace natural history and
ethnography. It was the productiveness of this simplification that made
the twins so powerful, and the obvious falsity of the original premise
was increasingly forgotten.3 Economy and ecology thus each became
sites for algorithms of progress-as-expansion.

EL que se pusieran las necesidades del individuo por sobre las necesidades colectivas ha provocado que no existan "encuentros" entre las personas y que las personas se limiten a las estaditicas.

```ad-note

Hmong are proud of their patrilineal clan organization, and, accord-
ing to ethnographer William Geddes, clans have been key to forming
long-distance ties among men.11 Clan relations allowed military leaders
to recruit outside their face-ŧo-face networks. This proved relevant when
the United States took over imperial oversight after the French defeat by
Vietnamese nationalists in 1954, thus inheriting the loyalty of French--
trained Hmong soldiers. One of those soldiers became General Vang
Pao, who mobilized Hmong in Laos to fight in behalf of the United
States, becoming what 1970s CIA director William Colby called “the
biggest hero of the Vietnam War.”12 Vang Pao recruited not just individ-
uals but villages and clans into the war. Although his claims to repre-
sent Hmong disguised the fact that Hmong also fought for the commu-
nist Pathet Lao, Vang Pao made his cause simultaneously a Hmong
cause and a U.S. anticommunist cause. Through his control over opium
transport, bombing targets, and CIA rice drops, as well as his charisma,
Vang Pao generated enormous ethnic loyalty, consolidating one kind
of “Hmong.”13 It is hard to think of a better example of contaminated
diversity.

Nuestra autora pone de ejemplo un grupo etnico para resaltar la importancia de como las distintas uniones o colaboraciones osn necesarias en el mundo y de como es que dan forma a nuestra identidad, cultura y mundo.

```ad-note

Worse yet, contaminated diversity is recalcitrant to the kind of
“summing up” that has become the hallmark of modern knowledge.
Contaminated diversity is not only particular and historical, ever
changing, but also relational. It has no self-contained units; its units
are encounter-based collaborations. Without self-contained units, it is
impossible to compute costs and benefits, or functionality, to any “one”
involved. No self-contained individuals or groups assure their self--
interests oblivious to the encounter. Without algorithms based on self--
containment, scholars and policymakers might have to learn something
about the cultural and natural histories at stake. That takes time, and
too much time, perhaps, for those who dream of grasping the whole in
an equation. But who put them in charge? If a rush of troubled stories is
the best way to tell about contaminated diversity, then it’s time to make
that rush part of our knowledge practices. Perhaps, like the war survi-
vors themselves, we need to tell and tell until all our stories of death and
near-death and gratuitous life are standing with us to face the chal-
lenges of the present. It is in listening to that cacophony of troubled sto-
ries that we might encounter our best hopes for precarious survival.

## Capitulo 3 

```ad-note

A scalable business, for example, does not change its organization as it
expands. This is possible only if business relations are not transforma-
tive, changing the business as new relations are added. Similarly, a scal-
able research project admits only data that already fit the research frame.
Scalability requires that project elements be oblivious to the indetermi-
nacies of encounter; that’s how they allow smooth expansion. Thus, too,
scalability banishes meaningful diversity, that is, diversity that might
change things.
Scalability is not an ordinary feature of nature. Making projects scal-
able takes a lot of work. Even after that work, there will still be interac-
tions between scalable and nonscalable project elements. Yet, despite
the contributions of thinkers such as Braudel and Bohr, the connection
between scaling up and the advancement of humanity has been so
strong that scalable elements receive the lion’s share of attention. The
nonscalable becomes an impediment. It is time to turn attention to the
nonscalable, not only as objects for description but also as incitements
to theory.

pág. 38

```

tations expanded and spread across the warm regions of the world. Their
contingent components—cloned planting stock, coerced labor, con-
quered and thus open land—showed how alienation, interchangeabil-
ity, and expansion could lead to unprecedented profits. This formula
shaped the dreams we have come to call progress and modernity. As
Sidney Mintz has argued, sugarcane plantations were the model for
factories during industrialization; factories built plantation-style alien-
ation into their plans.3 The success of expansion through scalability
shaped capitalist modernization. By envisioning more and more of the
world through the lens of the plantation, investors devised all kinds of
new commodities. Eventually, they posited that everything on earth—-
and beyond—might be scalable, and thus exchangeable at market val-
ues. This was utilitarianism, which eventually congealed as modern
economics and contributed to forging more scalability—or at least its
appearance.

pág. 39 y 40
```

Las plantaciones portuguesas de caña, devien en el ejemplo de escalabilidad por excelencia. Siendo uniformes y fáciles de reproducir se volvieron lapalntila apra la industrialización; (las fabricas de la revolucion industrial están basadas en ellas). Y de este modo pusieron los cimeintos para el capitalismo.

```ad-note

Contrast the matsutake forest: unlike sugarcane clones, matsutake
make it evident that they cannot live without transformative relations
with other species. Matsutake mushrooms are the fruiting bodies of an
underground fungus associated with certain forest trees. The fungus
gets its carbohydrates from mutualistic relations with the roots of its
host trees, for whom it also forages. Matsutake make it possible for host
trees to live in poor soils, without fertile humus. In turn, they are nour-
ished by the trees. This transformative mutualism has made it impossi-
ble for humans to cultivate matsutake. Japanese research institutions
have thrown millions of yen into making matsutake cultivation possi-
ble, but so far without success. Matsutake resist the conditions of the
plantation. They require the dynamic multispecies diversity of the for-
est—with its contaminating relationality.4
Furthermore, matsutake foragers are far from the disciplined, inter-
changeable laborers of the cane fields. Without disciplined alienation,
no scalable corporations form in the forest. In the U.S. Pacific North-
west, foragers flock to the forest following “mushroom fever.” They are
independent, finding their way without formal employment.

```

El cultivo del hongo Matdutake no puede darseun forma uniforme por sus ccaracteriticas especificas.

```ad-note

The challenge for thinking with precarity is to understand the ways
projects for making scalability have transformed landscape and society,
while also seeing where scalability fails—and where nonscalable ecolog-
ical and economic relations erupt. It is key to take note of the careers of
both scalability and nonscalability. But it would be a huge mistake to
assume that scalability is bad and nonscalability is good. Nonscalable
projects can be as terrible in their effects as scalable ones. Unregulated
loggers destroy forests more rapidly than scientific foresters. The main
distinguishing feature between scalable and nonscalable projects is not
ethical conduct but rather that the latter are more diverse because they
are not geared up for expansion. Nonscalable projects can be terrible or
benign; they run the range.

## Smelling

```ad-note

 Fungi are
famous for changing shape in relation to their encounters and environ-
ments. Many are “potentially immortal,” meaning they die from disease,
injury, or lack of resources, but not from old age. Even this little fact can
alert us to how much our thoughts about knowledge and existence just
assume determinate life form and old age. We rarely imagine life without
such limits—and when we do we stray into magic. Rayner challenges us
to think with mushrooms, otherwise. Some aspects of our lives are more
comparable to fungal indeterminacy, he points out. Our daily habits are
repetitive, but they are also open-ended, responding to opportunity and
encounter. What if our indeterminate life form was not the shape of our
bodies but rather the shape of our motions over time? Such indetermi-
nacy expands our concept of human life, showing us how we are trans-
formed by encounter. Humans and fungi share such here-and-now trans-
formations through encounter. Sometimes they encounter each other. As
another seventeenth-century haiku put it: “Matsutake / Taken by some-
one else / Right in front of my nose.”5 What person? What mushroom?

pág.47
```

Loa hongos estám abiertos a la indetermianción. Los seres humanoso vemos las cosas de una forma determinada. desde muy temprana edad, sabemoscomo seremsoe en el futuro pero que tal si como lso hongos pudieramos cambiar dependiendo de los encuentros que tengamos.

```ad-note

When
Koreans expanded to Japan in the eighth century, they cut down for-
ests. Pine forests sprung up from such deforestation, and with them
matsutake. Koreans smelled the matsutake—and they thought of home.
The first nostalgia: the first love of matsutake. It was in longing for
Korea that Japan’s new aristocracy first glorified the now famous au-
tumn aroma, Dr. Ogawa told us. No wonder, too, that Japanese abroad
are so obsessed with matsutake, he added. He ended with a funny story
about a Japanese American matsutake hunter he met in Oregon who, in

a badly garbled mixture of Japanese and English, saluted Dr. Ogawa’s
research, saying, “We Japanese are matsutake crazy!”

pág.49 - 50
```

Los hongos Matsutake son igual un producto de la nostalgia. Representa una epoca mejor para mcuhos japoneses.

```ad-note

While some Japanese may smell nostalgia in the forests made by
their disturbances, this is not, of course, the only feeling that people
bring to such wild places. Consider the smell of matsutake again. It is
time to tell you that most people of European origin can’t stand the
smell. A Norwegian gave the Eurasian species its first scientific name,
Tricholoma nauseosum, the nauseating Trich. (In recent years, taxono-
mists made an exception to usual rules of precedence to rename the
mushroom, acknowledging Japanese tastes, as Tricholoma matsutake.)
Americans of European descent tend to be equally unimpressed by the
smell of the Pacific Northwest’s Tricholoma magnivelare. “Mold,” “tur-
pentine,” “mud,” white pickers said, when I asked them to characterize
the smell. More than one moved our conversation to the foul smell of
rotting fungi. Some were familiar with California mycologist David
Arora’s characterization of the smell as “a provocative compromise be-
tween ‘red hots’ and dirty socks.”9 Not exactly something you would
want to eat. When Oregon’s white pickers prepare the mushroom as
food, they pickle it or smoke it. The processing masks the smell, making
the mushroom anonymous.

pág.51
```

El olor y sabor de un hongo tambei n representa una cultura, por ejemplo, muchos europeos y descendientes americanos de europeos no pueden soportar el olor del hongo.

```ad-note

It is not surprising, perhaps, that U.S. scientists have studied the
smell of matsutake to see what it repels (slugs), but Japanese scientists
have studied the smell to consider what it attracts (some flying insects).10
Is it the “same” smell if people bring such different sensibilities to the
encounter? Does that problem stretch to slugs and gnats as well as peo-
ple? What if noses—as in my experience—change? What if the mush-
room too can change through its encounters?

pág.51
```

El punto de vista del olor es un paradigma. Los gringos buscan que repele, y los japoneses que atrae.

```ad-note

The smell of matsutake wraps and tangles memory and history—-
and not just for humans. It assembles many ways of being in an affect--
laden knot that packs its own punch. Emerging from encounter, it
shows us history-in-ŧhe-making. Smell it.

El resultado del olor cambia dependiendo del ambiente y la historia el hongo es un testigo de estos cambios. El olor del hongo es un ejemplo del llamado "assemble".

## Part II After Progress: Salvage Accumulation

```ad-note

This rift between U.S. and Japanese segments of the commodity
chain guided my search. Different processes for making and accessing
value characterized each segment. Given this diversity, what makes this
part of that global economy we call capitalism?

El mercado diverso entre los EEUU y Japón es una clara divergencia de lso que conocemos como capitalismo.

## Capítulo 4 Working on the Edge

```ad-note

Even in factories, however, there are other elements of accumulation.
In the nineteenth century, when capitalism first became an object of
inquiry, raw materials were imagined as an infinite bequest from Na-
ture to Man. Raw materials can no longer be taken for granted. In our
food procurement system, for example, capitalists exploit ecologies not
only by reshaping them but also by taking advantage of their capaci-
ties. Even in industrial farms, farmers depend on life processes outside
their control, such as photosynthesis and animal digestion. In capitalist
farms, living things made within ecological processes are coopted for
the concentration of wealth. This is what I call “salvage,” that is, taking
advantage of value produced without capitalist control. Many capitalist
raw materials (consider coal and oil) came into existence long before
capitalism. Capitalists also cannot produce human life, the prerequi-
site of labor. “Salvage accumulation” is the process through which lead
firms amass capital without controlling the conditions under which
commodities are produced. Salvage is not an ornament on ordinary
capitalist processes; it is a feature of how capitalism works.

pág. 62 - 63
```

El capitalismo es un sistema que tiende a la acumulación del capital.
Entre uno de los elemetos que ese tienden a acaumular es los recursos naturales. La caumulacion de recursos que no se pueden controlar su producción, "acumulación salvaje".

```ad-note

Before you conclude that salvage accumulation is archaic, let me
turn to a contemporary example. Technological advances in managing
inventory have energized today’s global supply chains; inventory man-
agement allows lead firms to source their products from all kinds of
economic arrangements, capitalist and otherwise. One firm that helped
put such innovations in place is the retail giant Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart pi-
oneered the required use of universal product codes (UPCs), the black--
and-white bars that allow computers to know these products as inven-
tory.7 The legibility of inventory, in turn, means that Wal-Mart is able to
ignore the labor and environmental conditions through which its prod-
ucts are made: pericapitalist methods, including theft and violence, may
be part of the production process. With a nod to Woody Guthrie, we
might think about the contrast between production and accounting
through the two sides of the UPC tag.8 One side of the tag, the side with
the black-and-white bars, allows the product to be minutely tracked and
assessed. The other side of the tag is blank, indexing Wal-Mart’s total
lack of concern with how the product is made, since value can be trans-
lated through accounting. Wal-Mart has become famous for forcing its
suppliers to make products ever more cheaply, thus encouraging savage
labor and destructive environmental practices. Savage and salvage are
often twins: Salvage translates violence and pollution into profit.

cáp. 54
```

Wal Mart ha consolidado la cadena produccion capitalista a través de distintos factores siendo el ejemplo paradigmatico de la actualidad. Pues controla la producción no escalable y la escalabe a través de este proceso.
Lo que conlleva obviamte porblema como colonización y contaminación.

```ad-note
Is capitalism a single, over-
arching system that conquers all, or one segregated economic form
among many?14 Between these two positions, we might see how capitalist
and noncapitalist forms interact in pericapitalist spaces. Gibson-Graham
advise us, quite correctly I think, that what they call “noncapitalist” forms
can be found everywhere in the midst of capitalist worlds—rather than
just in archaic backwaters. But they see such forms as alternatives to cap-
italism. Instead, I would look for the noncapitalist elements on which
capitalism depends.

pág. 66
```

El capitalismo es un sistema de sistemas que ocnviven o unen en un posible "assemble", que bebe de sistemas que no son inherentemente capitalistas, pero que son aglutinados por este.

```ad-note

It takes concrete histories to make any concept come to life. And
isn’t mushroom collecting a place to look, after progress? The rifts and
bridges of the Oregon-ŧo-Japan matsutake commodity chain show capi-
talism achieved through economic diversity. Matsutake foraged and
sold in pericapitalist performances become capitalist inventory as they
are sent to Japan a day later. Such translation is the central problem of
many global supply chains. Let me begin by describing the first part of
the chain.

pág. 66
```

El capialismo absorbe las formas de pericapilismo.

```ad-note

It was this man’s expectation of the necessity of cultural translation
that first alerted me to the problem of salvage accumulation. In the
1970s, Americans expected the globalization of capital to mean the
spread of U.S. business standards all over the world. In contrast, Japa-
nese traders had become specialists in building international supply
chains and using them as mechanisms of translation to bring goods
into Japan without Japanese production facilities or employment stan-
dards. As long as these goods could be made into legible inventory in
their transit to Japan, Japanese traders could use them to accumulate
capital. By the end of the century, Japanese economic power had slipped,
and twentieth-century Japanese business innovations were eclipsed by
neoliberal reforms. But no one cares to reform the matsutake commod-
ity chain; it is too small and too “Japanese.” Here is a place, then, to look
for the Japanese trading strategies that rocked the world. At their center
is translation between diverse economies. Traders as translators become
masters of salvage accumulation.


```

La cadena de insumo fromada por al relaciones japonesas fue eclipsada por el neoliberalismoa mericano, aunque por ser un nicho el mercado de los hongos nunca cambió. existe una posibiblidad fuera del capitalismo.

### Conclusión del Capitulo 4

El Capitalismo es un sistema que bajo sus alas conglomera disitntos sistemas, entre elos ha logrado capitalizar, nunca mejor dicho bajo un concepto escalable, sistemas de produccción no escalables. Así, la produccion acumulasa de hongos por parte de lso grandes productores se vermada por la cosecha un anto anarquica de hongos que se vuelve uniforme a través de los hombres que comercian con el.

## Capitulo 5 Open ticket, Oregon

```ad-note

Matsutake picking is not the city, although haunted by it. Picking is
also not labor—or even “work.” Sai, a Lao picker, explained that “work”
means obeying your boss, doing what he tells you to. In contrast, mat-
sutake picking is “searching.” It is looking for your fortune, not doing
your job. When a white campground owner, sympathetic to the pickers,
talked to me about how the pickers deserved more because they work
so hard, getting up at dawn and staying through sun and snow, some-
thing nagged at me about her view. I had never heard a picker talk like
that. No pickers I met imagined the money they gained from matsutake
as a return on their labor. Even Nai Tong’s time babysitting was more
akin to work than mushroom picking.

pág. 77
```

Leo este fragmento y la visiónd eliebrtad que tiene estas personas va del emprendedurismo, hasta una visión un tanto del "Viejo Oeste", resulta interesante que convergen en el rechazo al trabajo o por lo menos al trabajo oficial.

```ad-note

Freedom/haunting: two sides of the same experience. Conjuring a
future full of pasts, a ghost-ridden freedom is both a way to move on
and a way to remember. In its fever, picking escapes the separation of
persons and things so dear to industrial production. The mushrooms
are not yet alienated commodities; they are effects of the pickers’ free-
dom. Yet this scene only exists because the two-sided experience has
purchase in a strange sort of commerce. Buyers translate freedom tro-
phies into trade through dramatic performances of “free market com-
petition.” Thus market freedom enters freedom’s jumble, making the
holding in abeyance of concentrated power, labor, property, and alien-
ation seem strong and effective.

pág. 79 - 80
```

Esa llamada libertad no es más que un fantasma. Aunque los hongos aun no son un bien que aliena del trabajador.

```ad-note

Let’s say it’s dark now, and pickers are lined up to sell at a buying
tent. They have picked this buyer not only because of his prices, but
because they know he is a skilled sorter. Sorting is just as important as
basic prices, because a buyer assigns a grade to each mushroom, and
the price depends on the grade. And what an art sorting is! Sorting is
an eye-catching, rapid-fire dance of the arms with the legs held still.
White men make it look like juggling; Lao women—ŧhe other cham-
pion buyers—make it look like Royal Lao dancing. A good sorter
knows a lot about the mushrooms just from touching them. Matsutake
with insect larvae will spoil the batch before it arrives in Japan; it is es-
sential that the buyer refuse them. But only an inexperienced buyer
cuts into the mushroom to look for larvae. Good buyers know from
the feel. They can also smell the provenance of the mushroom: its host
tree; the region it comes from; other plants, such as rhododendron,
which affect the size and shape. Everyone enjoys watching a good buyer
sort. It is a public performance full of prowess. Sometimes pickers pho-
tograph the sorting. Sometimes they also photograph their best mush-
rooms, or the money, especially when it is hundred dollar bills. These
are trophies of the chase.

pág. 81

El comprar hongos se ha vuelto un arte y me recuerda un poco un arte performatico.

Once I told an economist about this buying scene, and he was ex-
cited, telling me this was the true and basic form of capitalism, without
the pollution of powerful interests and inequalities. This was real capi-
talism, he said, where the playing field was level, as it should be. But is
Open Ticket’s picking and buying capitalism? The problem is that there
isn’t any capital. There is a lot of money changing hands, but it slips
away, never forming an investment. The only accumulation is happen-
ing downstream, in Vancouver, Tokyo, and Kobe, where exporters and
importers use the matsutake trade to build their firms. Open Ticket’s
mushrooms join streams of capital there, but they are not procured in
what seems to me a capitalist formation.


pág. 81
```

Es una forma de capitalismo sin capital. Aqupi no hay acumulación de capital

```ad-note

What is this “American psychology” then? There are too many peo-
ple and histories in Open Ticket to plunge directly into the coherence
through which we usually imagine “culture.” The concept of assem-
blage—an open-ended entanglement of ways of being—is more useful.
In an assemblage, varied trajectories gain a hold on each other, but in-
determinacy matters. To learn about an assemblage, one unravels its
knots. Open Ticket’s performances of freedom require following histo-
ries that stretch far beyond Oregon but show how Open Ticket’s entan-
glements might have come into being.7

### Conlusión capitulo 5

Existe un claro ejemplo de "assemble" en la forma enq ue se da el comercio de hongos.

Todo siendo más que una conjunción de factores que avanzan hacia un mismo fin de manera independiente.

## Conclusión del libro

El hongo es un ejemplo de como existen alternativas al cappitalismo dominante. Por como el hong se enfrenta a las preconcepciones que tenemos de cultivar y trabajo. Asi como de la naturaleza al ser un ejemplo de lo que la autora llama "assemblages" (ensambles)  para salir de neustro horrible sistemas capitalista individualista.
