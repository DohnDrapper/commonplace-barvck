When Hiroshima was destroyed by an atomic bomb in 1945, it is said, the first living thing to emerge from the blasted landscape was a matsutake mushroom.3

### Capítulo 1 "Art of noticing" "Arte de darte cuenta"

```ad-note

Job advocates imagined only wage contracts for healthy white men; the
foragers—disabled white veterans, Asian refugees, Native Americans,
and undocumented Latinos—were invisible interlopers. Conservation-
ists were fighting to keep human disturbance out of the forests; the
entry of thousands of people, had it been noticed, would hardly have
been welcome. But the mushroom hunters were mainly not noticed. At

El cultivo de hongos resulto en una alternativa de empleo par aaquellos que no tenia un contrato remunerado, en medio de la batallaentre medio ambiente y condiciones de trabajo.

```ad-note

A few years into the new century, the idea of a trade-off between 
jobs and the environment seemed less convincing. With or without
conservation, there were fewer “jobs” in the twentieth-century sense in
the United States; besides, it seemed much more likely that environ-
mental damage would kill all of us off, jobs or no jobs. We are stuck
with the problem of living despite economic and ecological ruination.
Neither tales of progress nor of ruin tell us how to think about collabo-
rative survival. It is time to pay attention to mushroom picking. Not
that this will save us—but it might open our imaginations.

El ambiente debe estar contemplado en nuestro palens para el futuro, pues si no existe no tendremso de donde mantanernos. La utora habal de como los hogos resultaron un medo de vida para lo inmigrantes que pasaban inadvertidos para los demás.

Precarity is the condition of being vulnerable to others. Unpredict-
able encounters transform us; we are not in control, even of ourselves.
Unable to rely on a stable structure of community, we are thrown into
shifting assemblages, which remake us as well as our others. We can’t
rely on the status quo; everything is in flux, including our ability to sur-
vive. Thinking through precarity changes social analysis. A precarious
world is a world without teleology. Indeterminacy, the unplanned na-
ture of time, is frightening, but thinking through precarity makes it
evident that indeterminacy also makes life possible.

pág.20

```

El mundo en el que vivimo maás que encntrarse en abundania se ahalla en un estado de precariedad, es decir, estamos vulnerables. UNa idea que no exploramo del todo. Pero que peude resonar en como la gente esta renunciando a sus trabajo y no buscando uno. Pues als condidicones en eque viven son precarias. Creoq ue puede relacionarse igual con esa idea de el "1%" mientras los demás apenas vivimos en muchos casos.

The only reason all this sounds odd is that most of us were raised on
dreams of modernization and progress. These frames sort out those
parts of the present that might lead to the future. The rest are trivial;
they “drop out” of history. I imagine you talking back: “Progress? That’s
an idea from the nineteenth century.” The term “progress,” referring to
a general state, has become rare; even twentieth-century modernization
has begun to feel archaic. But their categories and assumptions of im-
provement are with us everywhere. We imagine their objects every day:
democracy, growth, science, hope. Why would we expect economies to
grow and sciences to advance? Even without explicit reference to devel-
opment, our theories of history are embroiled in these categories. So,
too, are our personal dreams. I’ll admit it’s hard for me to even say this:
there might not be a collective happy ending. Then why bother getting
up in the morning?

pág. 20 y 21

```

El avance tecnologico es loq ue definido al historia de la humanidad y tenemos interiorizado el concepto de siempre ir hacia delante.

```ad-note

Progress is embedded, too, in widely accepted assumptions about
what it means to be human. Even when disguised through other terms,
such as “agency,” “consciousness,” and “intention,” we learn over and
over that humans are different from the rest of the living world because
we look forward—while other species, which live day to day, are thus
dependent on us. As long as we imagine that humans are made through
progress, nonhumans are stuck within this imaginative framework too.

```

El concepto de progresoe s creado y dicta la manera en que vemos el mundo. Cuando se habla de progreso se habla de _humanidad_ no se habla de als demas especies y de como se ven afectadas.

```ad-note

Patterns of unintentional coordination develop in assemblages. To
notice such patterns means watching the interplay of temporal rhythms
and scales in the divergent lifeways that gather. Surprisingly, this turns
out to be a method that might revitalize political economy as well as
environmental studies. Assemblages drag political economy inside them,
and not just for humans. Plantation crops have lives different from
those of their free-living siblings; cart horses and hunter steeds share
species but not lifeways. Assemblages cannot hide from capital and the
state; they are sites for watching how political economy works. If capi-
talism has no teleology, we need to see what comes together—not just
by prefabrication, but also by juxtaposition.

### Conclusión Capitulo 1

Para neustra autora el que se use el terminod eantropocenoresulta conrdictorio. En su popinon implica el domicio o el progreso de al raza humana, cosas que es dudosa. Desde su punto de vista es calro que vivimos en la precariedad, pues estamos vulnerables. Lo anteiro debido a que nuestrs idea de progreso no contempla a otras especies que contribuyen en nuestro tiempo. 
El progresoe s un idea que ignora todos lao factores que influyen en nuestro plenata. 
El llamado progreso ah desctruido incintables manera de trabaja ry esta po niedono en peligro de susbsisitir.
Nuestr autora creee que debdemos de revisar loq ue ella llama "assembles", es decir reuniones, dondeo distintos entes interacuan en su porpio porposito pero que se juxtaponen.

## Capítulo 2 "Contamianción como colaboración"

```ad-note

The assumption of self-containment made an explosion of new knowl-
edge possible. Thinking through self-containment and thus the self--
interest of individuals (at whatever scale) made it possible to ignore con-
tamination, that is, transformation through encounter. Self-contained
individuals are not transformed by encounter. Maximizing their inter-
ests, they use encounters—but remain unchanged in them. Noticing is
unnecessary to track these unchanging individuals. A “standard” indi-
vidual can stand in for all as a unit of analysis. It becomes possible to
organize knowledge through logic alone. Without the possibility of
transformative encounters, mathematics can replace natural history and
ethnography. It was the productiveness of this simplification that made
the twins so powerful, and the obvious falsity of the original premise
was increasingly forgotten.3 Economy and ecology thus each became
sites for algorithms of progress-as-expansion.

EL que se pusieran las necesidades del individuo por sobre las necesidades colectivas ha provocado que no existan "encuentros" entre las personas y que las personas se limiten a las estaditicas.

Hmong are proud of their patrilineal clan organization, and, accord-
ing to ethnographer William Geddes, clans have been key to forming
long-distance ties among men.11 Clan relations allowed military leaders
to recruit outside their face-ŧo-face networks. This proved relevant when
the United States took over imperial oversight after the French defeat by
Vietnamese nationalists in 1954, thus inheriting the loyalty of French--
trained Hmong soldiers. One of those soldiers became General Vang
Pao, who mobilized Hmong in Laos to fight in behalf of the United
States, becoming what 1970s CIA director William Colby called “the
biggest hero of the Vietnam War.”12 Vang Pao recruited not just individ-
uals but villages and clans into the war. Although his claims to repre-
sent Hmong disguised the fact that Hmong also fought for the commu-
nist Pathet Lao, Vang Pao made his cause simultaneously a Hmong
cause and a U.S. anticommunist cause. Through his control over opium
transport, bombing targets, and CIA rice drops, as well as his charisma,
Vang Pao generated enormous ethnic loyalty, consolidating one kind
of “Hmong.”13 It is hard to think of a better example of contaminated
diversity.

Nuestra autora pone de ejemplo un grupo etnico para resaltar la importancia de como las distintas uniones o colaboraciones osn necesarias en el mundo y de como es que dan forma a nuestra identidad, cultura y mundo.

```ad-note

Worse yet, contaminated diversity is recalcitrant to the kind of
“summing up” that has become the hallmark of modern knowledge.
Contaminated diversity is not only particular and historical, ever
changing, but also relational. It has no self-contained units; its units
are encounter-based collaborations. Without self-contained units, it is
impossible to compute costs and benefits, or functionality, to any “one”
involved. No self-contained individuals or groups assure their self--
interests oblivious to the encounter. Without algorithms based on self--
containment, scholars and policymakers might have to learn something
about the cultural and natural histories at stake. That takes time, and
too much time, perhaps, for those who dream of grasping the whole in
an equation. But who put them in charge? If a rush of troubled stories is
the best way to tell about contaminated diversity, then it’s time to make
that rush part of our knowledge practices. Perhaps, like the war survi-
vors themselves, we need to tell and tell until all our stories of death and
near-death and gratuitous life are standing with us to face the chal-
lenges of the present. It is in listening to that cacophony of troubled sto-
ries that we might encounter our best hopes for precarious survival.

## Capitulo 3 

```ad-note

A scalable business, for example, does not change its organization as it
expands. This is possible only if business relations are not transforma-
tive, changing the business as new relations are added. Similarly, a scal-
able research project admits only data that already fit the research frame.
Scalability requires that project elements be oblivious to the indetermi-
nacies of encounter; that’s how they allow smooth expansion. Thus, too,
scalability banishes meaningful diversity, that is, diversity that might
change things.
Scalability is not an ordinary feature of nature. Making projects scal-
able takes a lot of work. Even after that work, there will still be interac-
tions between scalable and nonscalable project elements. Yet, despite
the contributions of thinkers such as Braudel and Bohr, the connection
between scaling up and the advancement of humanity has been so
strong that scalable elements receive the lion’s share of attention. The
nonscalable becomes an impediment. It is time to turn attention to the
nonscalable, not only as objects for description but also as incitements
to theory.

tations expanded and spread across the warm regions of the world. Their
contingent components—cloned planting stock, coerced labor, con-
quered and thus open land—showed how alienation, interchangeabil-
ity, and expansion could lead to unprecedented profits. This formula
shaped the dreams we have come to call progress and modernity. As
Sidney Mintz has argued, sugarcane plantations were the model for
factories during industrialization; factories built plantation-style alien-
ation into their plans.3 The success of expansion through scalability
shaped capitalist modernization. By envisioning more and more of the
world through the lens of the plantation, investors devised all kinds of
new commodities. Eventually, they posited that everything on earth—-
and beyond—might be scalable, and thus exchangeable at market val-
ues. This was utilitarianism, which eventually congealed as modern
economics and contributed to forging more scalability—or at least its
appearance.

Las plantaciones portuguesas de caña, devien en el ejemplo de escalabilidad por excelencia. Siendo uniformes y fáciles de reproducir se volvieron lapalntila apra la industrialización; (las fabricas de la revolucion industrial están basadas en ellas). Y de este modo pusieron los cimeintos para el capitalismo.

```ad-note

Contrast the matsutake forest: unlike sugarcane clones, matsutake
make it evident that they cannot live without transformative relations
with other species. Matsutake mushrooms are the fruiting bodies of an
underground fungus associated with certain forest trees. The fungus
gets its carbohydrates from mutualistic relations with the roots of its
host trees, for whom it also forages. Matsutake make it possible for host
trees to live in poor soils, without fertile humus. In turn, they are nour-
ished by the trees. This transformative mutualism has made it impossi-
ble for humans to cultivate matsutake. Japanese research institutions
have thrown millions of yen into making matsutake cultivation possi-
ble, but so far without success. Matsutake resist the conditions of the
plantation. They require the dynamic multispecies diversity of the for-
est—with its contaminating relationality.4
Furthermore, matsutake foragers are far from the disciplined, inter-
changeable laborers of the cane fields. Without disciplined alienation,
no scalable corporations form in the forest. In the U.S. Pacific North-
west, foragers flock to the forest following “mushroom fever.” They are
independent, finding their way without formal employment.

El cultivo del hongo Matdutake no puede darseun forma uniforme por sus ccaracteriticas especificas.

```ad-note

The challenge for thinking with precarity is to understand the ways
projects for making scalability have transformed landscape and society,
while also seeing where scalability fails—and where nonscalable ecolog-
ical and economic relations erupt. It is key to take note of the careers of
both scalability and nonscalability. But it would be a huge mistake to
assume that scalability is bad and nonscalability is good. Nonscalable
projects can be as terrible in their effects as scalable ones. Unregulated
loggers destroy forests more rapidly than scientific foresters. The main
distinguishing feature between scalable and nonscalable projects is not
ethical conduct but rather that the latter are more diverse because they
are not geared up for expansion. Nonscalable projects can be terrible or
benign; they run the range.

El hongo es un ejemplo de como existen alternativas al cappitalismo dominante. Por como el hong se enfrenta a las preconcepciones que tenemos de cultivar y trabajo. Asi como de la naturaleza al ser un ejemplo de lo que la autora llama "assemblages" (ensambles)  para salir de neustro horrible sistemas capitalista individualista.
