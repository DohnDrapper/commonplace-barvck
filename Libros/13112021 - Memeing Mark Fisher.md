### Capitulo 1 Burn Down the Internet: Why the Online Left is Failing

```ad-note

This is in part as each one of these related yet idiosyncratic thinkers understood the horror of World War Two as somehow linked to the historical process of reification (the making into an object) of social and cultural relations in line with the tendency of capitalism to subjugate nature and humanity to the numerical count (and therefore to profit). Each saw this as a result of the project of the Enlightenment gone awry and suggested remedies by way of, respectively: artistic abstraction (Adorno); the association of constellations of objects and occurrences with which to interpret capitalism (Benjamin); a return to philosophizing (Horkheimer), and a freeing of eros via artistic expression (Marcuse).

Se relaciona un poco con lo de Wisecrack del club de la pelea de que todo debe de tener un proposito y al final es imposible escapar del capitalismo, pues de todo necesitas ser bueno u obtener un beneficio.

```ad-note

Above all, this book addresses the central idea of Capitalist Realism, choosing to return throughout to that one book of Fisher’s, in part as it parallels so closely the Frankfurt School, in part as it has become an iconic meme. That central idea is that capitalism is responsible for mental illness, especially depression. We can see this today in light of the covid lockdowns that have disproportionately affected poor people who are already subject to mental health problems due to environmental, work, and dietary factors. Though, moreover, we see it in a collective stasis brought about by the lockdown in a physical sense, but going far beyond the lockdown itself. It is a kind of sickness of society: the psycho-sociological parallel to years — decades, even — of a depressive economic malaise affecting everyone from the middle class down (and even trapping the elite in the inertia of capital, as everyone is ultimately beholden to the data economy). 

pp.10

```

Capitalismo realimo es la incapacidad para pensar fuera de la capacidad del capitalismo.

Es muy claro ver esto, yo lo he visto en Instagram, siempre que alguein habla o critica al mismo, sale el bato que te contesta: "Entonces vete", como si esa respuesta produjera más solución.

Lo que se relaciona un poco con Byun Chul Han, al ser nosotros mismos lo que perpetuamos esta economía.

Namely, that the left matches the right’s claim that America be made great again through a focus on individual grit by emphasizing the individual role we can all play in fostering a society managed for the benefit of the many, not the few. This would rise to the challenge of building a sense of purpose for the left that meets the heroic narrative of the right, predicated on the idea of dispelling enemy hordes and individually embodying the fate of the nation or race. Against this, what could
be more heroic and necessary than having an individual role in creating the first society that is truly open to races and nations, while giving an opportunity for all to develop their talents through gainful employment? Sanders and Corbyn could even have doubled down on the idea of a bogeyman in the form of the super-rich, or the 1 per cent, as both Sanders and Corbyn did to some degree. 
Yet, however compelling the left narrative of a class of underdogs rising up, deposing their overlords, and founding the fairest society known to humankind is, it perennially fails to gain electoral votes.

The meme production of the Yang Gang is just one incarnation of “shitposting,” which is essentially the practice of producing lo-fi montage images to deliberately disparage or undermine a cause. The tendency in itself has become more of an aesthetic than a political tactic, inspiring a descent into a trash visual culture whereby jokey, low resolution, and glitched productions are seen as inherently more valuable than the serious and polished output of the mainstream media. 

pp.12

```

El uso del shitposting como una practica política para desprestigiar un movimieto ha deja de ser una tactica politica para convertirse en una estetica.

La apropiación de simbolos debe de hacerse con cuidado para evitar confusiones.

Seen in this way the already sizable online left is no different to the bigger community of mostly female selfie producers who upload daily videos and pictures on TikTok and Instagram to generate attention and sponsorships for themselves, and clicks for the social media giants. Ultimately, internet corporations don’t care what you do, so long as you give them data — and the online left is simply one niche identity that achieves this. For young women uploading selfies, the internet plays on their insecurity at their own appearance. For young leftist meme producers of a similar age, social media companies play on threats made to their identity by right-wing imagery, or by leftists of other factions. None of this builds a coherent left-of-center movement, even if there is a growing communist, socialist, and anarchist presence online.

The lack of coherence within the online left is hardly surprising, given that the owners and shareholders of online social media apps, search engines, and shopping platforms are among the most powerful capitalists of all time. Indeed, we have to assume that the proliferation of online left content on major platforms such as YouTube and the streaming site Twitch is possible precisely because it is conducive to capitalism, a point that fits squarely within Mark Fisher’s observations in Capitalist Realism regarding the tendency of capitalism to incorporate and blunt the teeth of alternative movements.

```

La izquierda carece de un identidad fuerte en redes, a diferencia de la derecha que tien unos simbolos definidos.

Al internet dirigido por grandes compañias no le interesa que se forme una izquierda fuerte, le beneficia. Al final todo lo que no sea izquierda es algo que al final se integrará en el Capitalismo, según Fisher.

The left internet has unfortunately become one assembly line in a vast factory of irritation in which the principal production unit is contrarianism, as seen in the above examples: You think you’re this (a never Trumper) but I’ll sell you this (MAGA hat); you think I represent this (QAnon), but actually, I’m this (anti-QAnon with QAnon characteristics); we are aiming at this (left communitarianism), but really we only achieve this (further division). And yet we still ask why the left is failing.

It barely needs saying that if we are to use the internet to build a movement that will challenge the hegemony of major corporations we need to rewire it toward education, organization, and reflection. And to achieve this, we need memes that challenge the breakneck speed that platforms encourage us to browse at. It is for this reason I propose a “slow meme” movement that encourages use of the internet’s great resources in a considered way that challenges the data economy while building a community that can also function and meet offline. 

pp. 13

```

Para contrarrestar el avance tan rápido y con simbolos ya consolidados de la derecha, la izquierda debe usar "el meme lento". Un meme que en lugar de ser de fácil consumo es un meme que busca una reflexión.

```ad-note

In forging a new path, we have much to learn from historical absurdist and abstract movements such as Dada, Surrealism, Fluxus, Cubism, and Abstract Expressionism, that while facing down heinous right-wing and industrialist capitalist movements, sought answers in reflective works appealing to the subconscious or to some nonsensical abstract language that resisted the rationalist and capitalist injunction to produce ever more stuff, ever quicker. The efficacy of such movements can be seen in attempts to stifle them by totalitarian regimes or in the US government’s efforts to co-opt abstraction in the 1950s and 1960s, despite Pollock’s communism.

```

La izquierda contemporanea tiene que aprender de movimientos como el Dada, y Fluxus que lucharon contra el orden capitalista y movimientos afines.

While this will rightly be seen as indicative of a brazenly benign strategy of undermining truth and encouraging QAnon fantasy on the part of the Republican elite, led by Trump, there is a more profound long-term trend underlying the events of January 6. Simply, the increasingly horizontalized diffusion of culture, giving people unprecedented access to images, texts, movies, music, and code, which they can enjoy, reconfigure, parody, and appropriate in their own social media publications (as “content”), has left a great expectancy. Everyone feels they now have the right to consume and relate information and anyone can be an arbiter of “truth.” Yet this has led to less, not more, truth, as the only thing that matters is the growth of data and of profit margins for a class of data owners and finance speculators. 

pp. 14

```

Lo anterior responde a esa sensación de que al vivir en un cultura horizontal podemos tener acceso a imagenes y videos y producir "contenido" para compartir con nuestros conocidos al final lo que importa es la producción.

Es como la ira rápida del "Joker", la solucion es salir a las calles a destruir cosas y dispararle a la gente que no te gusta como te trata.

#### Conclusión Capitulo 1

La izquierdda debe de un usar un enfoque más pensado y lento que apele a la reflexión sobre el entorno a travpes del meme. Es erroneo intentar imitar el actuar de consumo rapido y de simbolos definidos de la extrema derecha. El hacer lo anterior, confunde a las personas.

La derecha debe optar por el actuar de movimientos como el Dada o Fluxus.

### Capítulo 2 The Work of Art in the Age of the Subscription Economy
---

```ad-note

The works of this loose grouping of thinkers (among them Theodor Adorno, Walter
Benjamin, Erich Fromm, Max Horkheimer, Leo Löwenthal, Herbert Marcuse, Friedrich Pollock), active in the inter and post-war period, have become a staple of cultural theory in the West over the last 3 decades. Perhaps its most famed text, Benjamin’s The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction (1935), is worth revisiting not least as it relates so closely to the cultural and political situation we currently live in.

pp. 15

```

Libro: _The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction (1935)_

La escuela de Frankfurt se menciona aquí como un escuela que puso al centro de su teoria a la persona.

&nbsp

```ad-note

Benjamin argued that the offer of “culture for all” can prove disastrous where there is no coincident shift in material relations. Such a
situation can lead ultimately to a frustrated population, open to exploitation by essentially right-wing populists (or in Benjamin’s era
the fascists who at the time governed over Italy and Germany, with Spain shortly to follow).

pp. 15

```

Walter Banjamin alegó la necesidad de que las personas de todas clases pudieran tener un experiencia estetica, aunuque la reproducciones perderían su "aura".

&nbsp

```ad-note

Of course, this has resonances with the way in which billions of people find themselves today to be protagonists of moving and still image media such as YouTube, Twitch, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, Twitter, and so on...These platforms offer the possibility — however remote — of an instant rise to fame, as well as potential access to seemingly boundless material wealth. Though the possibility that anyone might become famous or rich by no means suggests that everyone will, and the stakes inevitably leave many people disappointed. 

pp.15

```

Podríamos relacionar el culto a la imágen con la aparicón de los influencer y la fama instantanea en internet. Al final es una ilusión a menos que tengas el suficiente público.

   Nota: Mientras leía el parrafo sobre Twitch en la página 19, literalmente tenía de fondo a un streamer coreana, Tyongeee. Todo esta a las 9:31 pm del día 8 de Noviembre de 2021.

Podría relacionarse con el clip de José Ortuno sobre la invasión zombie, donde al final se ven los zombies reflejados en la pantalla.

&nbsp

```ad-note

While many such platforms exist, it will suffice here to focus on the streaming platform “Twitch” and the subscription content service “Patreon.” Twitch — which grew exponentially during covid lockdown as a streaming site in general but also as a site for left-wing streamers — was established in 2011 as a spinoff of the internet TV streaming service Justin.tv, and was developed for the live streaming of video gaming. Within 3 years Twitch gained around 50 million users prompting Justin.tv to close its services, as its owners focused on the niche video streaming market, which soon became hugely popular while attracting other niche streaming markets.

Patreon, on the other hand, began in 2013 as its founder, musician Jack Conte, sought a solution to the problem that many musicians face: how to monetize their huge online popularity in an era in which listeners are habituated to streaming and downloading for free. Since then it has become a global provider of “membership businesses” for creative practitioners. The model allows people to set monthly subscription rates in return for exclusive artworks, essays, videos, songs, etc., and is used by podcasters, independent publishers, Twitch, and YouTube content producers as a valuable source of supplemental income. As we approach the uncertainty of the post-covid era with inevitable cuts to cultural funding in many regions, such a model may help redefine cultural capital, and “culture” itself.

pp. 16

```

```ad-note

Though this event itself was not monetized, the creation of such independent online “happenings” alongside the potential for funding from sources such as Patreon and Twitch signals the possibility that artists might simply break free from the art market altogether. To some degree, the promise of riches and independence offered to the public via mass image reproduction in the 1930s is coming to fruition with an unprecedented level of freedom and financial independence offered to creative practitioners, as well as to gamers, meme producers, authors, and amateur models. 

pp.16

```

Sobre Twitch y Patreon, como una manera de escapar de las cadenas de los medios capitalistas. Al ser un espacio en el que la masa esta en contacto con la academía y las reglas de las artes superiores su bien no es que no se sigan son subertidas.

&nbsp

```ad-note

While bearing this in mind it should be considered that such platforms do little in themselves to challenge Benjamin’s hypothesis as set out in The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction. Indeed, the notion that an increased public appetite for wealth and power led by new mediatic forms will lead to the political class diverting the public’s attention through populist rhetoric appears to be borne out in very recent history. Bolsonaro, Trump, and Johnson are all clear examples of politicians who came to power by offering “the people” the voice that the public has by now come to believe it deserves, while all the time working against its interests. Each of their movements has appealed to the notion that the public is ready to override the advice of experts, a point made possible as new mediatic forms have increased the individuals’ desire to circumvent power structures and gatekeepers to celebrity. Where pre-existing media structures aimed to allow fame to only the chosen few, it is now even possible to become accidentally famous. In this climate, how do you explain to people that they are not worthy of attention and success? Or that their opinions are secondary to those of “experts” or career politicians?

pp.16

```

Bolsonar y Trump son unos vende humo. Quieren darle a la gente el poder de habla que se merecen aunque claramente trabajan contra los intereses de la misma.

&nbsp

```ad-note

Such a description in many ways fits into dreams of the early internet, which came into wide use 20 years after Attali published Noise: The Political Economy of Music, giving it an almost prophetic status. The early net was, however, subject to ncreasing expropriation by corporations, the largest among them being Google, Facebook, and Amazon. The extent to which independent initiatives can exist alongside these ompanies is open to debate and we must face the contradiction that neither Patreon nor Twitch would have the visibility without Google, and that Amazon bought the latter platform as far back as 2014. 

pp. 17

```

Pero cual es el impacto real que tienen estas plataformas comparado con los verdaderos reyes del Internet: ¿Google, Facebook, Amazon? Al final las grandes compañias evitan que la clase baja tenga el voz que de verdad busca o el impacto deseado.

Todos nuestro actuar en estas plataformas al final es un click para el poder capitalista.

&nbsp

```ad-note

Though this situation may become superseded, as a number of both male and female Twitch streamers, including “Amouranth,” “Justaminx,” and “Asian Andy,” have begun monetizing their sleep, by streaming themselves catching some Zzzzs as their audience looks on, occasionally tipping them (Asian Andy having earned $16,000 in one night’s sleep in February 2021). This might act as something of a warning to us all: in future, capitalism will profit not only from our every waking hour, but our every sleeping hour too. For anyone startled by the unnaturalness of all this, it may be worth taking a step back, going offline a couple of days and nights a week, and taking some time to read some media critique. Yet in so doing, be sure to note the tools we now have at our disposal for self-expression, congregation (at least online), and self-education. For there is a very real sense in which every loss that has been made by the worker and the left since the 1930s is accompanied by a gain. Are we being watched by the apps and devices we use? Yes, but so are our politicians, leading to greater transparency. Are we subject to a constant bombardment of images and information? Yes, but we can also all make and disseminate info and images constantly. Are we constantly making money for the capitalist system? Yes, but we have the tools to monetize our own creative output like never before. The list of simultaneous gains and losses goes on and on. The main thing to hold on to is the fact that the relative accessibility of media, both to users and producers, remains as crucial to the political arena today as in the 1930s. It is up to us to leverage the freedom (however little, however much) we have within the capitalist whole to prevent the slide into tyranny that Benjamin witnessed.

#### Conclusión Capitulo 2

Es posible usar lAs marmas del capitalismo en su contra. El ejmplo de _Patreon_ y _Twitch_ como un medio de expresión fuera de la Academia y el mercado de arte es claro. 

Aunque lo anterior no significa que las elites esten alentando la expresión, aún el Internet es controlado por las grandes corporaciones capitalsitas y cadad click beneficia al capitalismo.

### Capítulo 3 Adorno and Horkheimer: Elements of QAnon 

```ad-note
"Just as Benjamin argued that the populist right in the 1930s diverted people away from aspirations for increased wealth, they also diverted people away from their aspiration for increased knowledge (the two being effectively linked). As stated earlier, this was achieved via propaganda through military-style parades, posters, radio addresses, and so on. Today, it is achieved through a diversion of attention through social media advertising and the infiltration of the far right into Chan image boards and social media memes pages. Though the tendency is essentially the same, leading the elite to try to shut down the impulse toward the attainment of skills that might allow people to challenge power." 

pág.18

```

En la época en que vivimos no es muy difici entender los motivos por los que la Derecha se ha intentado apropiar de la definición de verdad. A partir de la apropiacion de la verdad, controla como la gente puede oponerse a las estructuras de poder dominantes.

&nbsp

```ad-note
"The QAnon movement would appear to be psychologically different. Despite the existence of varied mythic, paranoid, or basically speculative assertions of its origins, it appears to have grown up of its own accord from a singular 4Chan post in 2017 written by a shadowy 4Chan user, claiming to be a government agent with Q level security clearance. The original post was deliberately spread around the internet via Reddit and YouTube by a group of three individuals, with numerous social media meme accounts acting as hubs. These memes, while often obscure, encoded to some degree and sprawling in their range and output, tend very broadly to state that the world is run by a shady internationalist neoliberal cabal who practice satanism, child sex trafficking, and the drinking of human blood. Elements of this lowest common denominator conspiracy are traceable to Pizzagate, an online conspiracy that went viral in 2016, linking the Clintons to a satanic pedophile ring that operated out of Comet Ping Pong, a genuine pizzeria in Washington, D.C., which became the subject of hate mail and a gun attack following the allegations. The QAnon variant of this basically archetypal conspiracy builds upon this narrative, adding that Donald Trump is destined to save the US and world from the evil embodied in the neoliberal elite."

pág. 18

```

El origen de Qanon, viene como no de una serie de memes. a partir de distintos memes se creo una narartiva que evoluciona con el paso del tiempo.

Relacionarlo con el video de Wisecrack de la narrativa de los horoscopos. <==

La gente crea o piensa que su vida sigue una narativa, así Qanon llena un vacio existecial y le daun sentido a su vida.

&nbsp

```ad-note
It is the all-encompassing nature of QAnon that sets it apart from the initially disturbing yet ultimately dated and anyhow limited practice of the alt-right meme kid.
While a continuous thread of posts attributed to QAnon maintains some consistency to the conspiracy initially revealed by “Q,” the messages were spread by followers, effectively making the QAnon backstory a meme with considerable longevity, adaptability, and fidelity to original posts. This means that while we saw nothing comparable to the alt-right’s memetic output in 2016 during the 2020 election, the memetic spread of QAnon has done something that no singular meme or meme movement has managed up to now. A meme is usually looked at in terms of its spread across platforms and as mutated variations of a singular form, always ultimately gauged in terms of number. This makes it easy to identify and count, especially as many memes follow recognized image conventions within the meme community.
QAnon, however — like Pizzagate to a lesser degree — spreads into the psyche and lives of its followers, often via relatively niche message boards. It is as if the mindsbehind alt-right memes got together and plotted out a sequel to the 2016 US Election meme campaign, ratcheting up the element of narrative and the degree of audience participation. This time the memes would add up to a story that required a constant updating of information uploaded to “QDrops” — or dedicated message boards where information would be regularly deposited. Only there would appear to be no minds behind the narrative, or at least it wouldn’t matter if there initially had been a plan, because the narrative began to write itself. For the lack of a grand narrative defining our times, the individual and group psyche blighted by mass inequality, covid (and its aftermath), race tensions, and exponential diminishment of our communities, began to write its own story, collectively. Making it impossible to counter. It is as if a late 1990s experiment in online group novel writing got mixed up with the plot of a Black Mirror episode with the result being a perverse narrative that threatens civilization itself.

pág. 18-19

```

Qanon crece a partir de la narrativa de varias personas al mismo tiempo como si fuera un experimento de novela de finales de los 90´s. Donde a dferecnia de un meme la narrativa evoluciona con el pasar del tiempo.

Lo que sirve como una narrativa para distraer al publico de de derecha.

&nbsp

```ad-note
This function appears to be dualistic, serving both the elite’s need to sidetrack the public from discovering the basic dysfunctionality of capitalism by scapegoating the left, and the public’s need for a political narrative to follow in lieu of the one that would make the most sense — i.e. the Marxist analysis that is denied to them by the capitalist mass media.

El poder dominante usa la naartiva para impedir la radicalización de la población.

```ad-note

The grimace was one of a series of facial expressions or contortions that for Adorno and Horkheimer in the Dialectic of Enlightenment express in physical form the difficulty the human subject has in accepting its basic link to nature and the inevitability that it will finish up as lifeless as the ground to which he or she is destined. From the primordial scream in the face of fearful nature, to the laughter in the face of the Culture Industry’s products, to the grimace of angst and resignation at our fate and the impossibility of its escape, the fallibility of humanity’s attempts to overcome nature is made clear: we cannot, because we are nature. As such, any attempt to try to evade nature by “othering” it through the scapegoating of, for example, Jews, will ultimately fail, however far-reaching and tragic the effects of antisemitism were and are. 
For Adorno and Horkheimer, the grimace comes about as our attempt to “other” nature and its decaying effects rebound back upon us, because we are nature. The result is immense tension turned inward, as we have seen in the countless videos of Trump supporters, or anti-mask protestors. Their stooped Chad-like muscular forms, minimal gestures, and clenched teeth screams signifying, against all their best efforts, a fundamental emasculation (or perhaps dehumanization). Adorno and Horkheimer would describe this as a “mimesis” — of nature and death, undertaken to ward off the latter. After all, one of the most fundamental moves in self-defense, played out instinctively from pre-school, involves laying completely still: “playing dead.” The armed Trump supporters who protested on the steps of the Michigan State Capitol building against lockdown measures in April 2020, wearing gun belts, padded vests, and combat boots sported the exoskeletal look for precisely this reason: nothing, not covid, not even the national guard can kill an 80kg cockroach holding a semi-automatic. And yet, what is a cockroach if not precisely the horrific dead-man-walking that we all wish to avoid being?

pág. 19

```

El fascismo viene como una rebelión a la naturaleza de lo que no podemos cambiar, como un esfuerzo para evadir una situación que no es imposible evitar. 
Resulta interesante como los protestantes del capitolio iban armados como una especie de escudo contra nada.

```ad-note

In this light, movements such as QAnon can be seen as an attempt to force the “new.” Indeed narratives — so essential to human self-perception — are impossible without new moments to propel a story along and give us purpose. QAnon has perhaps been so successful as a viral message because it involves individuals in the construction of its narrative as it unfolds, allowing it to gain traction in the mind of its followers as they feel active in the process of creating a much-needed “story for our times.” Ultimately, of course, if the Enlightenment Project had run its full course it would not be necessary to seek solace from our fear of mortality in myths. Yet, as Adorno and Horkheimer argue in Dialectic of Enlightenment, rationalization reverts back to mythic thinking due to the innate human tendency to “identify” and control nature and other humans so as to ward off danger. The alternative, “non-identity” thinking, was to be sought in abstract art and music, which resist narration in their thoroughgoing obscurity. 

pág. 20-21
```

El exito de un movimiento como QAnon resulta de la sensación de triunfo de individuo que cree estar participando en la creación de un narrativa para nuestros días.
La racionalización viene de la necesidad del ser humano de control e identificar la naturaleza y a los demás.
Lo alternativo, "la no identidad"  que se resiste a tener una narrativa se halla en lo abstracto y música.

#### Conclusión cápitulo 3

Qanon es el máximo esponente del uso del internet por parte de la derecha contemporanea. Qanon utiliza por un lado el manejo de la verdad, a su conveniencia, como un instrumento paar robarles a la gente la capacidad de opornerse al orden existente.
Además, ha creado una especie de narativa colectiva que atrae a la gente que busca una guía y una identidad.
Al darle a la gente una identidad, Qanon, logra que la gente sienta que esta logrando algo en contra de la muerte y al naturaleza, cosas que no puede controlar.
Adorno y H consideran que la respuesta a esta manera de pensar debe provenir de "la no identidad".

### Capítulo 4 The memeing of Mark Fisher
 
```ad-note

The question “Is there anything ‘new’ anymore?” might be otherwise phrased “Is there anything worth getting out of bed for?”, a question familiar to anyone who has ever experienced depression. Capitalism makes us into objects of labor, thereby nullifying meaning as the possibility of vibrancy, of newness is impeded. After all, what that is new can be brought about by unthinking worker-objects or consumers? Given this, refusing to get out from under the blankets is practically a logical adaptation.

pág. 22

```

MArk Fisher habla de laimposibilidad de escapar del capitalismo debido a  la alieniacionsentido repecto de todo. nuestro autor considera un pararlelo de la situacipon pues la pandemia y sus encierros hanprovocado un edterioro en la salud tanot mental como fisica de la sociedad.

As such, it won’t be addressed here, except to say that its critique of callout and cancel culture was correct in identifying the depressive psychological effects of online critiques, which make it virtually impossible to
maneuver without double-checking if you may offend x, y, or z group (which can include tiny leftist factions even adjacent to your own position). It would appear that the very grievances which lead so many people to express themselves politically online — which amount in short to a lack of agency felt on the part of internet users in their daily life — in turn lead leftists to attack each other instead of the capitalist system. This becomes a vicious circle as the sheer amount of data distributed online raises the stakes in terms of how famous an individual could become by riding the crest of that angst-ridden data wave. Or conversely, how maligned they could become if they are called out for having the “wrong” opinion. The trouble is, it is very hard to choose to be the person riding that wave at any given time, a problem confounded by the fact that one could just as easily (or more probably) become a pariah instead, shunned by various factions of the online left rather than embraced by it

El debate de quien ha sufrido o mas o de quien es un cancer. Es imposible en la derecha oopiniar sin tener una lista donde se amrque a uiqn o se ha ofendido. En el mundo en el que vivimos las figuras importantes de izquierdas es mas fácil que destruyan a alguien a que lo apoyen.

&nbsp

```ad-note
The speed of meme activity and the high turnover of YouTube video production and reception basically impede philosophical reflection. And this may go a long way to explaining why the left is more fragmented than ever in its online incarnation, aside from the gaming-like competitive nature of social media and online video platforms. With regard to the latter point, one can quite literally sense that some online leftists really do want to “win” the online left “game,” while a number of smaller “players” enjoy backing a given Breadtuber, for example, to “win” against another. It is not uncommon to see the fans of Destiny, Vaush, Peter Coffin, Angie Speaks, or other B- to A-list online left personas turn on an opponent of their preferred leftist protagonist on Twitter with the brute violence of a lynch mob. The way in which lesser interlocutors can get caught in the crossfire and permanently canceled is enough to make anyone of a slightly nervous disposition wary of engaging on Twitter at all. This goes on in spite of many of the prominent personas of the online left being openly opposed to such behavior, including those mentioned above.

```

En el mismo sentidoq ue lo anterior, la cultura de la cancelación mas que construir un futuro nos impide tener un dialogo, muchas veces  la misma izquierda es la que hace las labores de la derecha.

In this sense, “shitposting” — its very name signifying a deliberate “race to the bottom” in terms of aesthetic values — is indicative of a tendency toward cynicism both in meme culture and millennial culture at large. This cynicism means that readily produced popular culture may be able to achieve what Adorno envisaged for high art abstraction in its basic refusal of any discernible value system: it basically exacerbates our discomfort, amplifying our discord with nature until the artifice we create around us comes tumbling down. The impossibility of capturing this moment in any sensible or reasoned way may be why it must come about via
experimentations into the fundamentally unknowable and dark realms of cultural expression. It also favors a clumsiness present in Beckett’s theatre and in the haplessness of Kafka’s Gregor Samsa as he wakes to find he has metamorphosed into a giant bug.

We don’t deserve to be triumphant because we are wholly complicit with the system we despise. We know that minerals for our mobile devices are often mined by slaves on the African continent but are somehow able to countenance this fact. If Adorno saw virtually no hope left in the 1940s to 1960s, what hope can we now have
for an escape from capitalism as we are constantly plugged into devices made by slaves that turn our leisure time into productive labor for the data economy? What today can resist the pervasive depression wrought by capitalism’s constant demands? Fisher answers this question at the end of Capitalist Realism with a decidedly Adornian response. Namely, if nothing is to be found outside the dark madness of capitalism, the Doomers among us will have to make our sickness into a credible protest movement:

We must convert widespread mental health problems from medicalized conditions into effective antagonisms. Affective disorders are forms of captured discontent;this disaffection can and must be channeled outwards, directed towards its real cause, Capital. 28

In this case, it does matter that the online tools which might set us free by giving us a mode of expression are the same ones that feed our depression, as it is precisely out of our depression (or anxiety, or psychosis) that we might find the will to go on. And in going on we may find uses for the internet that challenge the
data economy’s tendency toward competition. 
Of course, Fisher departed us young and at his own hands, and so did Benjamin, but Adorno survived until a heart attack took him at 63, and Marcuse to the age of 81. Above all, their words still inspire, and might help lead us to a new era of solidarity and creativity, if we can see past our own personal advancement online.

#### Conclusión Capitulo 4

El capitalismo se ha vuelto tan prminente que incluso ha logrado convertir en un meme a uno de sus masferevientes críticos, Mark Fisher.
La cantidad de contenido digital impide que exista un reflexion respecto de lso temas de actualiddad como ya se habia proouesto, loq ue provoca que la derecha no tenga margen de actuación. Adempas el poner de manifiesto ¿quien ha sufrido mas? nos lleva a la cultura de la cancelación, que destruye a lso pequeños y polariza una izquierda ya separarda. 
El mem como impgan resulta en un artifico que nos deprime.  La camoetitividad e hipervelocidad de contenid del internet evita que tengamos una capacidadd e reflexión.
Pero surgen cosas como el shit posting que en su cinismo le quietan el artifcio a la imgen y nos acercan a la objeto natural.
Siie internet es quien nos alimeta nuestra depresón y ansiedad pero tambien es el modo enque se peude salir d este circulo a través de él.

### Capítulo 5 Benjamin and the Digital Flaneur

```ad-note
The mixture of lassitude and objectless rage conveyed in Cobain’s voice was clearly not modeled for effect, yet he was paraded on MTV and countless other TV shows, radio broadcasts, and concert stages precisely as if it was. This is the same tendency that led Fisher himself to become a meme, reducing his theory to caricatured
soundbites. 
Though aside from capitalism aping our best musicians, theorists, and artists so that they become parodies of themselves, it threatens our very existence as living beings in the fullest and truest sense. Arguably a “life” requires new moments just as a heart cannot only beat once, but must beat constantly for the human body to
function. Life without new moments becomes drab and objective, this being effectively Marx’s complaint against the alienating effect of repetitive labor. The purpose of what Adorno termed the “culture industry” is to rid from art the capacity to create new and shocking moments that might shake people from their objective
complacency as workers whose sole purpose is to produce capital.

pág. 26

Written in Minima Moralia, a book sub-headed “Reflections from Damaged life,” these lines indicate what has been lost to us as the capitalist system appropriates art as mere decoration meant to placate worker subjects so that they remain in their objectified state. Not long after Nirvana’s meteoric rise — spanning just 3 years from Nevermind’s release to Cobain’s death in April 1994 — major record labels stopped pushing bands grown in the garage by angry young guys and gals and started manufacturing bands, or at least carefully screening them to weed out any genuine rebelliousness.

After all, when is anyone ever reading Marx, or anything, especially today, without half a mind on something else? [...]  Indeed, if, as Adorno and Benjamin would agree, capitalism inflects all human experience, we have no choice but to conduct critiques of capitalism with an awareness of its intrusion on our thought.

```

Adorno’s term “shudder” signals the shock the viewer of art experiences as they relive the primal scream that primitive man voiced at his realization of our separation from nature. Whereas Benjamin’s phantasmagoria signals that all of history comprises our experience of the now thereby bringing an immediacy to our interaction both with art and consumer products as if, one could argue, the originary primal scream of our ancestors had not ended but was in fact being perpetually voiced in response to the accumulated debris of history arising from that scream.

pág.27
```

Adorno mira comoe l hobre se sperar de al naturaleza a trvpes del arte.

&nbsp

```ad-note

Certainly, the idea of walking the glitzy streets of hyperspace with the intention of documenting it and thereby revealing its links to the history of capitalist domination would seem well-intentioned. There is, after all, a well-documented mass of young left-leaning meme producers, shitposters, YouTube video makers, and
streamers who seem as yet unable or unready to manifest or get close to real political power (if we discount examples of Twitch streamers such as Hbomberguy or Lance from “The Serfs” appearing in Twitch streams with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez). Perhaps, though, they could better understand power by taking a look around at
the vast cultural depository they are embedded within — the internet. 
Though before diving headlong into what would be a very long and involved project, it is worth asking if Benjamin’s basic formulation as outlined here holds true today. Do the characteristics of online media, which are quite distinct from any prior media form, not distinguish it from the Benjaminian phantasmagoria? Most
importantly: can the audience reconfigure history in new constellations given the proximity of power to the act of viewing in a data economy (if such a possibility ever existed)? 

pág.28
```

A travésd ela fantasmagoria podemos obtener un punto donde se salga de al produccion capitalista y hablemso de shot posting como metodo de entender la historia y cambair a nuestro favor.

&nbsp

```ad-note

In considering this question, it is important to note that, as with many terms in Benjamin’s output, the origins of the term phantasmagoria are not entirely defined. In one interpretation it represents a group of commodities that together have a spell-like effect on the viewer, similar to that of a phantasmagoric scene of the eighteenth century, wherein props and lighting would be used to create ghost-like effects. Yet in another, it simply describes the mechanism of commodity fetishism, the process by which the commodity exerts an influence on the human purchaser or owner based on assumed properties extraneous to it (for example, the toothpaste that makes you smile more). The distinction here is significant as, on the one hand, we have the possibility for assemblages of objects to create specific meanings, yet on the other, we have a blanket effect of commodification. The former allows for varied possibilities in terms of constellations of different objects producing different effects. The latter definition suggests an imposed homogeneity — i.e. the absolute commodification of society as people become slaves to objects. The key to understanding these two different versions of phantasmagoria with their wildly differing outcomes is another loosely defined term of Benjamin’s, the “dialectical image.” 
The dialectical image is a notion that permeates The Arcades Project, and which was reportedly originally born from conversations between Benjamin and, variously, Adorno, Gretel Adorno, Horkheimer, and Benjamin’s long-term mistress, Asja Lacis. Aside from in The Arcades Project, it has no clear elucidation, meaning we are left
with the notes that make up that opus to try and fathom what is meant by it. This has given many theorists a headache, as they try to piece together a method and potential praxis linked to the term. 

pág. 28
```

Fantasmagoría(2): Un efecto de la comodidad fetichista en la qu eun objeto tien un efecto enla persoasn basado en propiedad que aume que el objeto posee.

&nbsp

```ad-note
The moment of the dialectical image is the point at which we as viewers of the tomb or meme are snapped into ourselves as we feel the past intersect with the present finite moment, shocking us out of a complacent acceptance of our alienation at the hands of capital (though Cecil’s tomb as a memento mori was presumably
supposed to shock the viewer out of their complacent life of sin and distance from God).

pág.29
```

```ad-note
Put otherwise, Adorno wished to state that any truth content emerging from the artwork would have to be on account of its materiality and not of the imagination either of its producer or the audience. It is the imagination, rather, that arises from the material conditions of an artwork or commodity and the world it was produced in. It is those material conditions, embedded in the artwork, that for Adorno result in a moment of shock for the viewer of the radically abstract artwork as they are exposed to the reality of the human’s link to the natural object and the impossibility of surpassing that link (and our mortality) via scientific discovery or capitalist production. This shock, or “shudder,” is felt as a feeling of oneness with the artwork, and therefore the wider natural object, is interrupted by the realization that the work comprises components that arise from human labor, and thereby reveal our estrangement from nature through capitalism. 

pág.29
```


Para adorno ese moeto de qshock pertenece a la materialidad de objeto, deriva en un choque al darnos cuenta que el trabajo  es una extrañeza de la naturaleza a travles del capitalismo.

&nbsp

```ad-note

And one might agree with Adorno that quotes like these lack a sense of urgency as regards preparedness for Marxist-Leninist revolution (or anything approaching it) — except, of course, Adorno looked barely prepared himself. In any case, in a society where industrial building processes are key to the economy, who has time to take a tortoise for a walk? Only surely a beneficiary of capitalism. Indeed, tortoise walking (apparently a popular pastime in early-nineteenth century Paris) brings to mind some of the more frivolous meme formats, demonstrating the absolute dearth of purpose or meaning in the lives of young people living in developed nations. These include the practice of lip-synching to lines from movies or dancing to 15-second segments of songs (15 seconds being the maximum length of a TikTok video, although four videos can be strung together into a one-minute sequence). Specific dance routines include The WAP, based on thrusting moves from the video to Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion’s hit song, and Tap In, set to SAweetie’s homonymous song. These moves are emulated by tens to hundreds of thousands of mostly female amateur dancers who can command as many as millions of views each. While incomparable to taking tortoises for a walk, in their utter uselessness and studied, even
forced, casualness they share something in common with the flaneur. And here it is worth bearing in mind that only a perverse material reality could have made going for a walk with a tortoise “in 1839” seem like a good idea. These material realities are also what made, again, “The attitude of the flaneur,” the “epitome of the
political attitude of the middle classes during the Second Empire.” This attitude, which is far from one of action, is arguably the same one that makes young women, and sometimes men, contort themselves today to fit the oblong frame of the smartphone (the dimensions of a TikTok video), the dimensions of which make theirsexualized movements appear hideously automated. 
Anyone who has seen young people preparing a dance for social media will note the amount of time they put into rehearsing and re-enacting the dance, erasing the prior recording until they get it just right. As Mark Fisher observed in relation to SMS text messages during a talk given at the University of Warwick in 2011: 
...it’s typical for teenagers to spend, you know, up to an hour comprising an sms text message of 150 characters just to assure they get the right level of nonchalance

What this tells us is that while what often appears relaxed is actually labor, this is only ultimately achievable due to there being a lack of a requirement to labor in the workplace, or at school. This is indeed the proverbial elephant in the room — that which cannot be said but which is more than apparent — that Benjamin reveals with both his fixation on flaneurism and the way he assembles factoids and quotes about bourgeois Paris without peppering them with calls to arms. That elephant in the room regards the level to which the cozy existence the bourgeois class enjoyed in Paris in the nineteenth century was equaled by Benjamin’s and Adorno’s existence, which while blighted by the horrors of World War Two, was relatively insulated compared to their working-class Jewish counterparts or to political dissidents in Germany. 

pág. 30
```

Imagen dialectica de Walter Benjamisn: Loq ue para unos parece relajacion en trabajo, derivado de lafalta de al necesidad de trabajar ya sea en la escuela o en el trabajo.

&nbsp

```ad-note

For Benjamin, the heroic, the shock, the calamitous were not necessary marks of an awareness of the true conditions of capital, perhaps as he saw these conditions all around him and felt the bourgeois complicity with capitalism so much that he wished to enunciate it in all its banality. 
This is not for a moment to equate bourgeois experience with working-class experience, in terms of awareness of the reality of class struggle. Yet, the ability for relatively privileged people to grasp the reality of class struggle remains as fundamental today as it always has been. This is because, however much the working class
and lower-middle class of Western countries struggle, they are hugely more privileged than the productive classes of Asia, Africa, and South America. At the same time, it is worth considering the extent to which we today enjoy conveniences that were unimaginable to the affluent bourgeois scholars of the Frankfurt School. As
such, parallels can be seen with Benjamin’s practice as a hash-addled flaneur taking in the sites of the Paris streets and arcades and today’s digital flaneur, who dedicates portions of her or his day to observing other people, their memes, and online stores: or with friendship duos who spend hours contorting themselves to fit
the rectangular proportions of their phone screen in a manner that looks more-or-less effortless. All so they can share the resulting 15-second long TikTok video to gain the adoration of other friends, who have been doing the same thing all day.

That is to say, Benjamin has intended to apprehend via The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction, the material fact and sequence of events that led to the (then) current historical moment via a consideration of its specific media composition: TV, radio, mass publications. What he saw, as discussed here in Chapter 2,
was the accumulation of uneven property relations coming to expression via the grievances of mass media audiences who felt cheated given the gap between what the media offered and what was actually available to them. Today, we take aloof flaneur-like walks through digital arcades replete with memes and videos co-opted as
data commodities. In doing so, we might take time to assemble constellations of these image objects so as to reconstruct from them the history of capitalism and to allow possible future assemblages conducive to a socialist vision. This may require a slowing down of our media consumption, not to a turtle’s pace, but enough to make reflection upon the mechanisms underlying our current digital era of capitalism possible. In this way, as we look back on the accumulated debris of history, like Klee’s angel of history, we will be able to reconfigure it rather than be configured by it. This is how “each era may dream of the next,” and it comes about as a seizing of the truth of the material relations of the present through the apprehension of cultural or architectural objects (the moment of the dialectical image). The Dancing Coffin as a dialectical image may lead us to realize our mortality and the fact that we are alive now, and therefore need to make use of our short lifespans. Yet if you are truly a digital flaneur you’d stop to reflect on the masses of Western teens and adults who routinely laugh at the funereal rights of the people of Ghana (an ex Portuguese, then British colony) and the workers who dance as they carry coffins. Before then reflecting on the Western zoomers and millennials that contort themselves to achieve the right “look” for videos that serve to enrich the data economy, asking yourself, “How did history arrive here?”

#### Conclusion

Se nos present ane esta capitulo varios conceptos que tienn cierta aplicacion en la actualidad.

Por un lado se nos presenta "Shrured" de Adorno,  aquel mometo en el que un objeto artistico nos revela como estamos laenados de al naturaleza por el trabajo capitalista.

Por otro la fantasmagoria de Benjamín, sinedoe elque un obejto provoque uen nosotros una reaccion similar a a algo hetereo, vamos que Benjamis ve el debros como la realizacion de nuestra historia perpetuada a travpes de un producto artitico.

Pero sobre tod la imagen dialectica que si bien no hay una definición acordada, nuestr oauotr al ejemplicfica en el trabajo que  se hace al no existir el requerimiento del mismo, por ejemplo el bailar un tiktokm que parece diversio pero en realidad es unproceso rtadado y complicado.

LA derecha debe provocar que todo este consumo de tuite, facebook, y demas se disminuya  para porvicar un relfaxión, donde podemaso ver como pasamos a eniquecer la econmia capitalista con nuestras "diversiones".

### Capítulo 6 Psychedelic Dreams: Marcuse, Fisher, and Acid Communism 

```ad-note

It’s hard to say who this reflects worse on in hindsight: Adorno for refusing to join his students in fermenting a societal uprising from campus, or Marcuse, as the very unlikely face of a new social and sexual permissiveness in America. Today we tend to perceive that the gender and civil rights movements should be led by representatives of the groups that seek empowerment. Black Lives Matter urge that white protestors yield to the authority of any present black comrades in any given situation. In this light, it’s hard to see what Marcuse had to offer the African-American Angela Davis. But when you consider that Adorno tried to deter Davis from returning from Frankfurt (where she studied at Frankfurt University) to the US to join the protest movement altogether, Marcuse immediately emerges as the more progressive of the two. As Davis has stated, Adorno “suggested that my desire to work directly in the radical movements of that period was akin to a media studies scholar deciding to become a radio technician.”

pág.31
```

Adorno y Marcuse fueron unos tipos mas de palabras que de acciones.

&nbsp

```ad-note

Ultimately, their work is collectively concerned with the consideration of entirely harmless subject areas. Sure, they turned the focus of academia to popular culture and identified class subjugation at play in the offerings of the culture industry, yet aren’t endless reflections on media objects liable to detract precisely from any action that might be taken to overthrow the system itself? And here you see, perhaps, Adorno’s real interest (and lack of understanding) in comparing activism to becoming a radio technician. For Adorno, both activism and manual labor in the service of the culture industry amounted to tinkering at the service of a vast societal mechanism that would ultimately anyhow be subject to the antagonisms of class and race division. This was assured by a basically flawed mode of human thinking that leads us to “identify” and categorize nature and humans in a bid to control them. All that a protest might achieve, if anything, was to rejig the social spectrum so that one set of humans would have control of the mass, instead of another, as evidenced in
the rise of European Fascism and Soviet Communism. But isn’t this the kind of judgment that only a comfortably middle-class person can make (even acknowledging the horror of being a German Jew who fled the Nazis)? 

pág. 31
```

```ad-note

Fast forward to the 2020s and this is still a paramount concern, and to a degree that Marcuse possibly couldn’t have foreseen. What passed for permissiveness in the 1960s would appear staid by today’s standards, as graphic porn is readily available on ubiquitous devices, and mainstream TV and film feature a level of sexualization
perpetually verging at least on salaciousness. Eroticism has itself assumed a memetic quality as amateur models frequently become “insta famous” by posting near nude selfie images, or make money on platforms such as OnlyFans, which allows models to charge a subscription for nude or semi-nude photos of themselves. These
platforms of course bring in a level of choice and, potentially, an empowerment that is difficult to dismiss as somehow “controlled.” Perhaps here it makes sense to dispense with the relative notion of “freedom of choice” and to simply ask to what extent people are subjugated today, irrespective of the choices they make. Such an
approach not only cuts right through the problem of people thinking they are free while being actually subjugated (as Marcuse argues they were in the 1960s), but is also particularly apt in the social media era, where constant choice is the motor of entertainment (rather than, say, choosing a film and then sitting still for 90 minutes).

pág.32
```

Esz el uso de OnlyFans una cosificación? Al fnal es una manera de satisfacer un deseo solo en un medida que sirva a capitalismo.

&nbsp

```ad-note

That is to say, if we all enjoy a certain level of comfort, it does not mean that we are all comfortable, but rather that capitalism has adjusted our base level of acceptable comfort. The same could be said, more or less, with regard to desire — in that any degree of satiation accords with a redefinition of desire itself. This is in part because desire is effectively something we can only feel toward things we don’t have. Though beyond this, even momentary satiation of sexual desire is today often achieved at the fulfillment of something so banal and easily achieved (the opening of a web page) that the sexual functioning is reduced to being just another human need that can be satisfied by a phone browser. 
Of course, there is a debate over whether or not a woman’s, or man’s, ability to earn money from posting images of herself online might constitute empowerment, yet it would be a very specific desire that held as its principal aim the production of nude selfies for sale online. That is to say, there may be some degree of
satisfaction in providing sexualized images to paying subscribers, but this doesn’t mean the provider is not subjugated. One only needs to recall the 19-year-old Belle Delphine selling her “used bathwater” as “Gamer Girl Bathwater” to fans on her Patreon account for $30 for a small bottle. After all, it is possible to conceive of a society in which Delphine wouldn’t want or need to sell her used bathwater in order to feel economically or sexually fulfilled. 

pág. 32
```

La sexualidad al servicio del capitalismo la ha convertido en una necesidad mas que se satisfacetan banalmente como abrir una pagina web.
El capitalismo conveirte todo en progreso y rentabilidad.

&nbsp

```ad-note

From the purview of the male user of online sexual services and material (the market for Delphine’s bathwater), the meme “Are You Winning, Son?” speaks of the awkwardness of a culture that is both permissive and repressed. The meme, which derives from a comic panel probably first published in 2014 on 4Chan, features a crude MS Paint drawing of a father arriving home and asking “Are ya winning, Son?” to his gamer offspring. In the original comic the son has a VR headset on and is saying “please please play with my breasts” to a character that he is interacting with, in the virtual realm. 50 The meme resurfaced in 2020 in many variants, though what is most interesting here is the way in which the father in the meme inadvertently yet accurately describes the status of sex as an activity that can be “won” in the twenty-first century. Belle Delphine, who released a real sex video to her OnlyFans audience on Christmas Day 2020, would be an ostensible winner of the sex “game,”
given the vast amounts of money she makes from male fans. However, her eventual making of a real porn video 18 months after teasing fans with deceptively titled videos uploaded to PornHub shows that she may not be entirely in control of her own image. While those earlier videos featured titles such as Belle Delphine Strokes
Two BIG Cocks, leading to a video of Delphine stroking two live roosters, her Christmas Day porn video featured hardcore sex acts. For many, this signaled a fall from grace, not specifically because she performed real sex acts on camera, but because she lost her critical edge in doing so. After all, Delphine had previously been famed for hubristically offering everything to her fans and delivering nothing.

Indeed such platitudes to art will likely always remain true, perhaps becoming more poignant the further from utopia we become. This is because art — synonymous with imagination — becomes fantastical in inverse proportion to reality, explaining why our dreams in covid lockdown have become especially vivid. It may also be why
both the main figures of the Frankfurt School and Fisher found themselves curiously restricted to making vague allusions to the power of art as their only remedy to the autocratic barbarity of capitalism. As capitalism aims to reduce both the stimulus we encounter and our desire for it, such that our desires can be easily exhausted, it is our duty and biological imperative to fight back with more elaborate desires — be they political, erotic, or plain fantastical.

```ad-note

The ultimate aim of the online left, following Adorno’s predilection to abstraction, Benjamin for the phantasmagoria, Marcuse for the Great Refusal, and Fisher for the harnessing of mental illness for revolutionary aims, should be to foster the conditions for “in real life” activity aimed at reclaiming our desire and creatively sublimating it to the fostering of a communitarian society. To get hung up on the policy
details — whether anarchist, communist, or socialist — would be over cumbersome here, and indeed endless poring over the minutiae of left theory is directly counterproductive to the irrationalist aim of an Acid Left movement. What the online left should be doing in the wake of covid is encouraging far-out creative output
that challenges the tendency of the data economy to push us toward quantitative goals both online and in real life. 

pág.35
```

La creatividad en repuesta al conformidad es la respuesta de la derecha.

```ad-note

In recent years, the right-wing has now openly adopted the irrationality that runs through nature as a smokescreen to hide their profit motive. It is up to the left to adopt irrationality as a motor for the
irrational act of compassion — the one political calling that can justify our empty human existence. 
It is from the depths of anxiety and depression that such an unrealistic mission arises. It is from the depths of psychosis that this calling is given an aesthetic form.
These sicknesses — caused, as Fisher argues, by capitalism — carry a kaleidoscopic reordering function that colors human ethics in the rich, hypersensitive palette of a manic episode or psychedelic experience. 
Of course, such experiences need mediating with objective experience. To achieve this, we need an incendiary subcultural movement that rips up the political and cultural canons that led us to the impasse we’re at, realigning our vision via a reconfiguration of the constellations of image objects we find online. Like digital flaneurs we need to seamlessly incorporate our psychic reality with the image culture of online arcades at our own pace, seizing what’s useful to challenge consumerist psychopathy and algorithm-pleasing cultural output along the way. Then we need to turn what we find outward onto the streets in the formation of a grassroots
movement that can reconfigure the debris of capitalism in new community-based formations. This is the task of Acid Leftism in these coming years.
