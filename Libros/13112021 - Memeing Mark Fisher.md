### Capitulo 1 Burn Down the Internet: Why the Online Left is Failing 
---

```ad-note

This is in part as each one of these related yet idiosyncratic thinkers understood the horror of World War Two as somehow linked to the historical process of reification (the making into an object) of social and cultural relations in line with the tendency of capitalism to subjugate nature and humanity to the numerical count (and therefore to profit). Each saw this as a result of the project of the Enlightenment gone awry and suggested remedies by way of, respectively: artistic abstraction (Adorno); the association of constellations of objects and occurrences with which to interpret capitalism (Benjamin); a return to philosophizing (Horkheimer), and a freeing of eros via artistic expression (Marcuse).

Se relaciona un poco con lo de Wisecrack del club de la pelea de que todo debe de tener un proposito y al final es imposible escapar del capitalismo, pues de todo necesitas ser bueno u obtener un beneficio.

```ad-note

Above all, this book addresses the central idea of Capitalist Realism, choosing to return throughout to that one book of Fisher’s, in part as it parallels so closely the Frankfurt School, in part as it has become an iconic meme. That central idea is that capitalism is responsible for mental illness, especially depression. We can see this today in light of the covid lockdowns that have disproportionately affected poor people who are already subject to mental health problems due to environmental, work, and dietary factors. Though, moreover, we see it in a collective stasis brought about by the lockdown in a physical sense, but going far beyond the lockdown itself. It is a kind of sickness of society: the psycho-sociological parallel to years — decades, even — of a depressive economic malaise affecting everyone from the middle class down (and even trapping the elite in the inertia of capital, as everyone is ultimately beholden to the data economy). 

pp.10

```

Capitalismo realimo es la incapacidad para pensar fuera de la capacidad del capitalismo.

Es muy claro ver esto, yo lo he visto en Instagram, siempre que alguein habla o critica al mismo, sale el bato que te contesta: "Entonces vete", como si esa respuesta produjera más solución.

Lo que se relaciona un poco con Byun Chul Han, al ser nosotros mismos lo que perpetuamos esta economía.

Namely, that the left matches the right’s claim that America be made great again through a focus on individual grit by emphasizing the individual role we can all play in fostering a society managed for the benefit of the many, not the few. This would rise to the challenge of building a sense of purpose for the left that meets the heroic narrative of the right, predicated on the idea of dispelling enemy hordes and individually embodying the fate of the nation or race. Against this, what could
be more heroic and necessary than having an individual role in creating the first society that is truly open to races and nations, while giving an opportunity for all to develop their talents through gainful employment? Sanders and Corbyn could even have doubled down on the idea of a bogeyman in the form of the super-rich, or the 1 per cent, as both Sanders and Corbyn did to some degree. 
Yet, however compelling the left narrative of a class of underdogs rising up, deposing their overlords, and founding the fairest society known to humankind is, it perennially fails to gain electoral votes.

The meme production of the Yang Gang is just one incarnation of “shitposting,” which is essentially the practice of producing lo-fi montage images to deliberately disparage or undermine a cause. The tendency in itself has become more of an aesthetic than a political tactic, inspiring a descent into a trash visual culture whereby jokey, low resolution, and glitched productions are seen as inherently more valuable than the serious and polished output of the mainstream media. 

pp.12

```

El uso del shitposting como una practica política para desprestigiar un movimieto ha deja de ser una tactica politica para convertirse en una estetica.

La apropiación de simbolos debe de hacerse con cuidado para evitar confusiones.

```ad-note

Seen in this way the already sizable online left is no different to the bigger community of mostly female selfie producers who upload daily videos and pictures on TikTok and Instagram to generate attention and sponsorships for themselves, and clicks for the social media giants. Ultimately, internet corporations don’t care what you do, so long as you give them data — and the online left is simply one niche identity that achieves this. For young women uploading selfies, the internet plays on their insecurity at their own appearance. For young leftist meme producers of a similar age, social media companies play on threats made to their identity by right-wing imagery, or by leftists of other factions. None of this builds a coherent left-of-center movement, even if there is a growing communist, socialist, and anarchist presence online.

The lack of coherence within the online left is hardly surprising, given that the owners and shareholders of online social media apps, search engines, and shopping platforms are among the most powerful capitalists of all time. Indeed, we have to assume that the proliferation of online left content on major platforms such as YouTube and the streaming site Twitch is possible precisely because it is conducive to capitalism, a point that fits squarely within Mark Fisher’s observations in Capitalist Realism regarding the tendency of capitalism to incorporate and blunt the teeth of alternative movements.

pp. 12

```

La izquierda carece de un identidad fuerte en redes, a diferencia de la derecha que tien unos simbolos definidos.

Al internet dirigido por grandes compañias no le interesa que se forme una izquierda fuerte, le beneficia. Al final todo lo que no sea izquierda es algo que al final se integrará en el Capitalismo, según Fisher.

```ad-note

The left internet has unfortunately become one assembly line in a vast factory of irritation in which the principal production unit is contrarianism, as seen in the above examples: You think you’re this (a never Trumper) but I’ll sell you this (MAGA hat); you think I represent this (QAnon), but actually, I’m this (anti-QAnon with QAnon characteristics); we are aiming at this (left communitarianism), but really we only achieve this (further division). And yet we still ask why the left is failing.

It barely needs saying that if we are to use the internet to build a movement that will challenge the hegemony of major corporations we need to rewire it toward education, organization, and reflection. And to achieve this, we need memes that challenge the breakneck speed that platforms encourage us to browse at. It is for this reason I propose a “slow meme” movement that encourages use of the internet’s great resources in a considered way that challenges the data economy while building a community that can also function and meet offline. 

pp. 13

```

Para contrarrestar el avance tan rápido y con simbolos ya consolidados de la derecha, la izquierda debe usar "el meme lento". Un meme que en lugar de ser de fácil consumo es un meme que busca una reflexión.

&nbsp

```ad-note

In forging a new path, we have much to learn from historical absurdist and abstract movements such as Dada, Surrealism, Fluxus, Cubism, and Abstract Expressionism, that while facing down heinous right-wing and industrialist capitalist movements, sought
answers in reflective works appealing to the subconscious or to some nonsensical abstract language that resisted the rationalist and capitalist injunction to produce ever more stuff, ever quicker. The efficacy of such movements can be seen in attempts to stifle them by totalitarian regimes or in the US government’s efforts to co-opt abstraction in the 1950s and 1960s, despite Pollock’s communism. 

pp. 14

```

La izquierda contemporanea tiene que aprender de movimientos como el Dada, y Fluxus que lucharon contra el orden capitalista y movimientos afines.

While this will rightly be seen as indicative of a brazenly benign strategy of undermining truth and encouraging QAnon fantasy on the part of the Republican elite, led by Trump, there is a more profound long-term trend underlying the events of January 6. Simply, the increasingly horizontalized diffusion of culture, giving people unprecedented access to images, texts, movies, music, and code, which they can enjoy, reconfigure, parody, and appropriate in their own social media publications (as “content”), has left a great expectancy. Everyone feels they now have the right to consume and relate information and anyone can be an arbiter of “truth.” Yet this has led to less, not more, truth, as the only thing that matters is the growth of data and of profit margins for a class of data owners and finance speculators. 

pp. 14

```

Lo anterior responde a esa sensación de que al vivir en un cultura horizontal podemos tener acceso a imagenes y videos y producir "contenido" para compartir con nuestros conocidos al final lo que importa es la producción.

Es como la ira rápida del "Joker", la solucion es salir a las calles a destruir cosas y dispararle a la gente que no te gusta como te trata.

#### Conclusión Capitulo 1

La izquierdda debe de un usar un enfoque más pensado y lento que apele a la reflexión sobre el entorno a travpes del meme. Es erroneo intentar imitar el actuar de consumo rapido y de simbolos definidos de la extrema derecha. El hacer lo anterior, confunde a las personas.

La derecha debe optar por el actuar de movimientos como el Dada o Fluxus.

### Capítulo 2 The Work of Art in the Age of the Subscription Economy
---

```ad-note

The works of this loose grouping of thinkers (among them Theodor Adorno, Walter
Benjamin, Erich Fromm, Max Horkheimer, Leo Löwenthal, Herbert Marcuse, Friedrich Pollock), active in the inter and post-war period, have become a staple of cultural theory in the West over the last 3 decades. Perhaps its most famed text, Benjamin’s The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction (1935), is worth revisiting not least as it relates so closely to the cultural and political situation we currently live in.

pp. 15

```

Libro: _The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction (1935)_

La escuela de Frankfurt se menciona aquí como un escuela que puso al centro de su teoria a la persona.

&nbsp

```ad-note

Benjamin argued that the offer of “culture for all” can prove disastrous where there is no coincident shift in material relations. Such a
situation can lead ultimately to a frustrated population, open to exploitation by essentially right-wing populists (or in Benjamin’s era
the fascists who at the time governed over Italy and Germany, with Spain shortly to follow).

pp. 15

```

Walter Banjamin alegó la necesidad de que las personas de todas clases pudieran tener un experiencia estetica, aunuque la reproducciones perderían su "aura".

&nbsp

```ad-note

Of course, this has resonances with the way in which billions of people find themselves today to be protagonists of moving and still image media such as YouTube, Twitch, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, Twitter, and so on...These platforms offer the possibility — however remote — of an instant rise to fame, as well as potential access to seemingly boundless material wealth. Though the possibility that anyone might become famous or rich by no means suggests that everyone will, and the stakes inevitably leave many people disappointed. 

pp.15

```

Podríamos relacionar el culto a la imágen con la aparicón de los influencer y la fama instantanea en internet. Al final es una ilusión a menos que tengas el suficiente público.

   Nota: Mientras leía el parrafo sobre Twitch en la página 19, literalmente tenía de fondo a un streamer coreana, Tyongeee. Todo esta a las 9:31 pm del día 8 de Noviembre de 2021.

Podría relacionarse con el clip de José Ortuno sobre la invasión zombie, donde al final se ven los zombies reflejados en la pantalla.

&nbsp

```ad-note

While many such platforms exist, it will suffice here to focus on the streaming platform “Twitch” and the subscription content service “Patreon.” Twitch — which grew exponentially during covid lockdown as a streaming site in general but also as a site for left-wing streamers — was established in 2011 as a spinoff of the internet TV streaming service Justin.tv, and was developed for the live streaming of video gaming. Within 3 years Twitch gained around 50 million users prompting Justin.tv to close its services, as its owners focused on the niche video streaming market, which soon became hugely popular while attracting other niche streaming markets.

Patreon, on the other hand, began in 2013 as its founder, musician Jack Conte, sought a solution to the problem that many musicians face: how to monetize their huge online popularity in an era in which listeners are habituated to streaming and downloading for free. Since then it has become a global provider of “membership businesses” for creative practitioners. The model allows people to set monthly subscription rates in return for exclusive artworks, essays, videos, songs, etc., and is used by podcasters, independent publishers, Twitch, and YouTube content producers as a valuable source of supplemental income. As we approach the uncertainty of the post-covid era with inevitable cuts to cultural funding in many regions, such a model may help redefine cultural capital, and “culture” itself.

pp. 16

```

```ad-note

Though this event itself was not monetized, the creation of such independent online “happenings” alongside the potential for funding from sources such as Patreon and Twitch signals the possibility that artists might simply break free from the art market altogether. To some degree, the promise of riches and independence offered to the public via mass image reproduction in the 1930s is coming to fruition with an unprecedented level of freedom and financial independence offered to creative practitioners, as well as to gamers, meme producers, authors, and amateur models. 

pp.16

```

Sobre Twitch y Patreon, como una manera de escapar de las cadenas de los medios capitalistas. Al ser un espacio en el que la masa esta en contacto con la academía y las reglas de las artes superiores su bien no es que no se sigan son subertidas.

&nbsp

```ad-note

While bearing this in mind it should be considered that such platforms do little in themselves to challenge Benjamin’s hypothesis as set out in The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction. Indeed, the notion that an increased public appetite for wealth and power led by new mediatic forms will lead to the political class diverting the public’s attention through populist rhetoric appears to be borne out in very recent history. Bolsonaro, Trump, and Johnson are all clear examples of politicians who came to power by offering “the people” the voice that the public has by now come to believe it deserves, while all the time working against its interests. Each of their movements has appealed to the notion that the public is ready to override the advice of experts, a point made possible as new mediatic forms have increased the individuals’ desire to circumvent power structures and gatekeepers to celebrity. Where pre-existing media structures aimed to allow fame to only the chosen few, it is now even possible to become accidentally famous. In this climate, how do you explain to people that they are not worthy of attention and success? Or that their opinions are secondary to those of “experts” or career politicians?

pp.16

```

Bolsonar y Trump son unos vende humo. Quieren darle a la gente el poder de habla que se merecen aunque claramente trabajan contra los intereses de la misma.

&nbsp

```ad-note

Such a description in many ways fits into dreams of the early internet, which came into wide use 20 years after Attali published Noise: The Political Economy of Music, giving it an almost prophetic status. The early net was, however, subject to ncreasing expropriation by corporations, the largest among them being Google, Facebook, and Amazon. The extent to which independent initiatives can exist alongside these ompanies is open to debate and we must face the contradiction that neither Patreon nor Twitch would have the visibility without Google, and that Amazon bought the latter platform as far back as 2014. 

pp. 17

```

Pero cual es el impacto real que tienen estas plataformas comparado con los verdaderos reyes del Internet: ¿Google, Facebook, Amazon? Al final las grandes compañias evitan que la clase baja tenga el voz que de verdad busca o el impacto deseado.

Todos nuestro actuar en estas plataformas al final es un click para el poder capitalista.

```ad-note

Though this situation may become superseded, as a number of both male and female Twitch streamers, including “Amouranth,” “Justaminx,” and “Asian Andy,” have begun monetizing their sleep, by streaming themselves catching some Zzzzs as their audience looks on, occasionally tipping them (Asian Andy having earned $16,000 in one night’s sleep in February 2021). This might act as something of a warning to us all: in future, capitalism will profit not only from our every waking hour, but our every sleeping hour too. For anyone startled by the unnaturalness of all this, it may be worth taking a step back, going offline a couple of days and nights a week, and taking some time to read some media critique. Yet in so doing, be sure to note the tools we now have at our disposal for self-expression, congregation (at least online), and self-education. For there is a very real sense in which every loss that has been made by the worker and the left since the 1930s is accompanied by a gain. Are we being watched by the apps and devices we use? Yes, but so are our politicians, leading to greater transparency. Are we subject to a constant bombardment of images and information? Yes, but we can also all make and disseminate info and images constantly. Are we constantly making money for the capitalist system? Yes, but we have the tools to monetize our own creative output like never before. The list of simultaneous gains and losses goes on and on. The main thing to hold on to is the fact that the relative accessibility of media, both to users and producers, remains as crucial to the political arena today as in the 1930s. It is up to us to leverage the freedom (however little, however much) we have within the capitalist whole to prevent the slide into tyranny that Benjamin witnessed.

Es una paradoja que las mismas armas que sirven para la libertad de expresión mas libre sena las misma que se usan contra nosotros. Como habla en el primer capítulo, el acceso horizontal a las imágenes y videos  es clave en nuestra época.

#### Conclusión Capitulo 2

Es posible usar lAs marmas del capitalismo en su contra. El ejmplo de _Patreon_ y _Twitch_ como un medio de expresión fuera de la Academia y el mercado de arte es claro. 

Aunque lo anterior no significa que las elites esten alentando la expresión, aún el Internet es controlado por las grandes corporaciones capitalsitas y cadad click beneficia al capitalismo.

### Capítulo 3 Adorno and Horkheimer: Elements of QAnon 

```ad-note
"Just as Benjamin argued that the populist right in the 1930s diverted people away from aspirations for increased wealth, they also diverted people away from their aspiration for increased knowledge (the two being effectively linked). As stated earlier, this was achieved via propaganda through military-style parades, posters, radio addresses, and so on. Today, it is achieved through a diversion of attention through social media advertising and the infiltration of the far right into Chan image boards and social media memes pages. Though the tendency is essentially the same, leading the elite to try to shut down the impulse toward the attainment of skills that might allow people to challenge power." 

pág.18

```

En la época en que vivimos no es muy difici entender los motivos por los que la Derecha se ha intentado apropiar de la definición de verdad. A partir de la apropiacion de la verdad, controla como la gente puede oponerse a las estructuras de poder dominantes.

```ad-note
"The QAnon movement would appear to be psychologically different. Despite the existence of varied mythic, paranoid, or basically speculative assertions of its origins, it appears to have grown up of its own accord from a singular 4Chan post in 2017 written by a shadowy 4Chan user, claiming to be a government agent with Q level security clearance. The original post was deliberately spread around the internet via Reddit and YouTube by a group of three individuals, with numerous social media meme accounts acting as hubs. These memes, while often obscure, encoded to some degree and sprawling in their range and output, tend very broadly to state that the world is run by a shady internationalist neoliberal cabal who practice satanism, child sex trafficking, and the drinking of human blood. Elements of this lowest common denominator conspiracy are traceable to Pizzagate, an online conspiracy that went viral in 2016, linking the Clintons to a satanic pedophile ring that operated out of Comet Ping Pong, a genuine pizzeria in Washington, D.C., which became the subject of hate mail and a gun attack following the allegations. The QAnon variant of this basically archetypal conspiracy builds upon this narrative, adding that Donald Trump is destined to save the US and world from the evil embodied in the neoliberal elite."

pág. 18

```

El origen de Qanon, viene como no de una serie de memes. a partir de distintos memes se creo una narartiva que evoluciona con el paso del tiempo.

Relacionarlo con el video de Wisecrack de la narrativa de los horoscopos. <==

La gente crea o piensa que su vida sigue una narativa, así Qanon llena un vacio existecial y le daun sentido a su vida.

```ad-note
It is the all-encompassing nature of QAnon that sets it apart from the initially disturbing yet ultimately dated and anyhow limited practice of the alt-right meme kid.
While a continuous thread of posts attributed to QAnon maintains some consistency to the conspiracy initially revealed by “Q,” the messages were spread by followers, effectively making the QAnon backstory a meme with considerable longevity, adaptability, and fidelity to original posts. This means that while we saw nothing comparable to the alt-right’s memetic output in 2016 during the 2020 election, the memetic spread of QAnon has done something that no singular meme or meme movement has managed up to now. A meme is usually looked at in terms of its spread across platforms and as mutated variations of a singular form, always ultimately gauged in terms of number. This makes it easy to identify and count, especially as many memes follow recognized image conventions within the meme community.
QAnon, however — like Pizzagate to a lesser degree — spreads into the psyche and lives of its followers, often via relatively niche message boards. It is as if the mindsbehind alt-right memes got together and plotted out a sequel to the 2016 US Election meme campaign, ratcheting up the element of narrative and the degree of audience participation. This time the memes would add up to a story that required a constant updating of information uploaded to “QDrops” — or dedicated message boards where information would be regularly deposited. Only there would appear to be no minds behind the narrative, or at least it wouldn’t matter if there initially had been a plan, because the narrative began to write itself. For the lack of a grand narrative defining our times, the individual and group psyche blighted by mass inequality, covid (and its aftermath), race tensions, and exponential diminishment of our communities, began to write its own story, collectively. Making it impossible to counter. It is as if a late 1990s experiment in online group novel writing got mixed up with the plot of a Black Mirror episode with the result being a perverse narrative that threatens civilization itself.

pág. 18-19

```

Qanon crece a partir de la narrativa de varias personas al mismo tiempo como si fuera un experimento de novela de finales de los 90´s. Donde a dferecnia de un meme la narrativa evoluciona con el pasar del tiempo.

Lo que sirve como una narrativa para distraer al publico de de derecha.

```ad-note
This function appears to be dualistic, serving both the elite’s need to sidetrack the public from discovering the basic dysfunctionality of capitalism by scapegoating the left, and the public’s need for a political narrative to follow in lieu of the one that would make the most sense — i.e. the Marxist analysis that is denied to them by the capitalist mass media.

pág. 19

```

El poder dominante usa la naartiva para impedir la radicalización de la población.

```ad-note

The grimace was one of a series of facial expressions or contortions that for Adorno and Horkheimer in the Dialectic of Enlightenment express in physical form the difficulty the human subject has in accepting its basic link to nature and the inevitability that it will finish up as lifeless as the ground to which he or she is destined. From the primordial scream in the face of fearful nature, to the laughter in the face of the Culture Industry’s products, to the grimace of angst and resignation at our fate and the impossibility of its escape, the fallibility of humanity’s attempts to overcome nature is made clear: we cannot, because we are nature. As such, any attempt to try to evade nature by “othering” it through the scapegoating of, for example, Jews, will ultimately fail, however far-reaching and tragic the effects of antisemitism were and are. 
For Adorno and Horkheimer, the grimace comes about as our attempt to “other” nature and its decaying effects rebound back upon us, because we are nature. The result is immense tension turned inward, as we have seen in the countless videos of Trump supporters, or anti-mask protestors. Their stooped Chad-like muscular forms, minimal gestures, and clenched teeth screams signifying, against all their best efforts, a fundamental emasculation (or perhaps dehumanization). Adorno and Horkheimer would describe this as a “mimesis” — of nature and death, undertaken to ward off the latter. After all, one of the most fundamental moves in self-defense, played out instinctively from pre-school, involves laying completely still: “playing dead.” The armed Trump supporters who protested on the steps of the Michigan State Capitol building against lockdown measures in April 2020, wearing gun belts, padded vests, and combat boots sported the exoskeletal look for precisely this reason: nothing, not covid, not even the national guard can kill an 80kg cockroach holding a semi-automatic. And yet, what is a cockroach if not precisely the horrific dead-man-walking that we all wish to avoid being?

pág. 19

```

El fascismo viene como una rebelión a la naturaleza de lo que no podemos cambiar, como un esfuerzo para evadir una situación que no es imposible evitar. 
Resulta interesante como los protestantes del capitolio iban armados como una especie de escudo contra nada.

```ad-note

In this light, movements such as QAnon can be seen as an attempt to force the “new.” Indeed narratives — so essential to human self-perception — are impossible without new moments to propel a story along and give us purpose. QAnon has perhaps been so successful as a viral message because it involves individuals in the construction of its narrative as it unfolds, allowing it to gain traction in the mind of its followers as they feel active in the process of creating a much-needed “story for our times.” Ultimately, of course, if the Enlightenment Project had run its full course it would not be necessary to seek solace from our fear of mortality in myths. Yet, as Adorno and Horkheimer argue in Dialectic of Enlightenment, rationalization reverts back to mythic thinking due to the innate human tendency to “identify” and control nature and other humans so as to ward off danger. The alternative, “non-identity” thinking, was to be sought in abstract art and music, which resist narration in their thoroughgoing obscurity. 

pág. 20-21
```

El exito de un movimiento como QAnon resulta de la sensación de triunfo de individuo que cree estar participando en la creación de un narrativa para nuestros días.
La racionalización viene de la necesidad del ser humano de control e identificar la naturaleza y a los demás.
Lo alternativo, "la no identidad"  que se resiste a tener una narrativa se halla en lo abstracto y música.

#### Conclusión cápitulo 4

Qanon es el máximo esponente del uso del internet por parte de la derecha contemporanea. Qanon utiliza por un lado el manejo de la verdad, a su conveniencia, como un instrumento paar robarles a la gente la capacidad de opornerse al orden existente.
Además, ha creado una especie de narativa colectiva que atrae a la gente que busca una guía y una identidad.
Al darle a la gente una identidad, Qanon, logra que la gente sienta que esta logrando algo en contra de la muerte y al naturaleza, cosas que no puede controlar.
Adorno y H consideran que la respuesta a esta manera de pensar debe provenir de "la no identidad".
