### Notas

+ Sociologist David Riesman was the first to chronicle this trend in his seminal book, _The Lonely Crowd_. He observed in 1950 that the ascendancy of post–World War II consumerism and corporations turned Americans’ focus outward, or “other-directed,” causing us to base our sense of self on other people’s perceptions of us. His words proved to be eerily prescient: “The other-directed person wants to be loved rather than esteemed.” That is, people who spend a lot of time seeking validation from others—which is taken to new heights in this nascent age of social media—equate this “fitting in” with a form of love on some deeper level. They consider being connected and accepted the same as being loved, even when it’s validation from acquaintances and virtual strangers.

+ Common wisdom, not to mention scores of studies, identifies white men fifty and older as the torchbearers of emotional isolation. As many of us know from recent articles on this topic, they are the ones slogging through chronic unemployment; outsourced, phased-out, or undercut careers; higher divorce rates among the upper middle-aged; and a country that increasingly looks far less “white” than the one they’ve always known. And, truth be told, the politically progressive online media outlets that cater to younger audiences don’t exactly help the situation by reflexively invoking the sweeping term “old white men” with utter, uncritical contempt. These are the men whose rate of suicide is spiking.
