Quotes: 
> "YouTube is, in effect, a reality show," she said. "The relationships among influencers add credibility by creating a sense of a world in which they operate and allows them to take advantage of the energy among characters rather than have to generate all the energy themselves."
>By creating drama between the characters on the YouTube "show," creators are more or less guaranteed attention and interest from their fans because they expand and twist the narrative. And with that intrigue comes more clicks, views, revenue, and brand deals.

>"In a parasocial relationship, the audience comes to feel that the personality is a friend and they experience the person as if they were in a reciprocal relationship, rather than a one-sided one," said Rutledge. "This experience is amplified in social media where influencers respond to some comments and fans, increasing the illusion of friendship."
