### Quotes

>Here, in the small towns of eastern Germany, neo-Nazism is less an ideology than a scene, a lifestyle. The young people around us, chowing down on their barbequed pork, sport t-shirts promoting extreme right-wing heavy rock bands and silver pendants in the shape of five-pointed stars. Neo-Nazism is a way to belong to something. Schroeder and Tommy Frenck are the group’s ideologues.

>Schroeder’s Thousand-Year Reich nostalgia is a species of fundamentalism. True, the term “fundamentalism” generally refers to a religion, and Nazism is not a religion in the conventional sense. The sociologist of religion James D. Hunter explains that “all fundamentalist sects share the deep and worrisome sense that history has gone awry. What ‘went wrong’ with history is modernity in its various guises. The calling of the fundamentalist, therefore, is to make history right again.” Alon Confino, a historian of modern Europe, writes about the way the Nazis imagined a world without Jews, and how this idea of racial purity drove them to craft a “new genesis,” an utterly new tradition of the origins of a new world order. In other words, they sought not just to conquer territory but also to conquer memory and history while expunging the Jews from them. Nothing could be more fundamentalist than this fantasy of primeval purity. The fantasy mandates that the modern unclean world must be purged by destruction, murder, and genocide.

>Like many fundamentalists, Schroeder is unable, or unwilling, to grapple with arguments that distinguish between identity and political opinion; people are merely pawns of their ancestry and always play the role written for them by their race or religion. Nazis are being denied their democratic right to free speech, he maintains: “I don’t think there’s a difference between us as a group, when they say all neo-Nazis are extremists and they should be in jail or if you say, in my opinion, that Jews have a lot of power in the banking sector.” I respond that Nazis are people who have decided to support a political idea. Jews are born as Jews; it’s not an identity they choose for themselves. “Yeah,” he says, uncomfortably. But that doesn’t stop him. “If Hitler had won the war,” Schroeder proclaims, “he would’ve become a great hero in the world. The one who loses is always denounced and becomes the bad guy. What would be the historical fact if Hitler had won the war? You wouldn’t be reading then about six million Jews or something. You’d read in history books that Hitler was great, the biggest German hero ever.”
