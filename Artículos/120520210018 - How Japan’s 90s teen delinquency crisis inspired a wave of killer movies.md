Quotes:
> As [employment rates for universities sunk](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2000/10/jap-o18.html) to just 66 per cent by 1998, children found themselves no longer able to meet the standards set by their parents. Schools became increasingly violent as bullying turned rife. Arrests of minors for serious crimes doubled. And heinous cases such as the [1997 Kobe Child Murders](https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/29/world/14-year-old-arrested-in-japan-for-the-brutal-slaying-of-a-child.html) dominated news headlines. In a 1999 study, the _New York Times_ [concluded](https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/12/world/japan-s-troubling-trend-rising-teen-age-crime.html) that “Japan’s Troubling Trend (of) Rising Teen-Age Crime” was a byproduct of the country’s single-minded industriousness; “the gutting of family life and playtime in the name of workplace performance and school achievement.”

> Takashi Miike is as good a place to start as any. An [icon of Japanese cult cinema](https://www.dazeddigital.com/film-tv/article/47956/1/the-relentless-cinema-of-takashi-miike-10-films-to-watch-after-first-love), he’s embraced the theme of kids-gone-wild countless times across his 100+ movie career, right up to 2020 crime flick [_First Love_](https://www.dazeddigital.com/film-tv/article/47704/1/takashi-miike-first-love-interview). One of the most important projects of his early career, though, was _Fudoh: The New Generation,_ a zany 1996 revenge caper about a posse of teenage assassins dispatching the grown-ups of Tokyo while still in their school uniforms.

> Memorable characters include an underage stripper who hides a dart gun between her legs, an eight-foot transfer student who murdered his parents in their sleep, and a pair of infant hitmen who, at one point, play football with the head of one of their teachers. Like most of the films discussed hereon, the blame is placed squarely on the previous generation: gang leader Fudoh’s top target is his own father, who committed the cardinal sin of murdering his oldest son. Spot the subtext.

>As the teen delinquency drama declined in the early 2000s, so, too did juvenile crime rates. By 2014 the annual number of minors treated as criminal suspects had dropped from [over 120,000 in 2005 to less than 50,000](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2015/05/28/editorials/juvenile-crime-and-punishment/). Juvenile murders, burglaries, arsons and rape cases also halved in the same period. This might be attributed to a number of legislative reforms, and the economy’s gradual improvement since the turn of the century – though the effects of the Lost Decade are still felt widely today across the country.

>As the West faces potential social, political, and economic unrest in the years to come, Generation Z will no doubt prove a vital case study to observe. If this recent period of Japanese history can tell us anything, it’s that vibrant cultural upheavals take place in the hands of the youth. Future independent filmmaking will surely follow that lead.

>For the murky times ahead, then, be sure to keep your eyes on the kids of tomorrow.

Notas:
* El cine es un reflejo de la realidad. El alto indice de criminalidad en Japón derivó en un serie de película hiperviolentas por la juventud inconforme.
* La hipercompetitividad de Jaón resultó en jovenes incapaces de cumplir con las expectativas de sus padres.
