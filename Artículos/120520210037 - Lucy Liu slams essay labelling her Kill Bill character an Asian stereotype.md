Quotes:
> “Why not call Uma Thurman, Vivica A Fox, or Daryl Hannah a dragon lady? I can only conclude that it’s because they are not Asian,” sais Liu. “I could have been wearing a tuxedo and a blond wig, but I still would have been labeled a dragon lady because of my ethnicity.”

>“Hollywood frequently imagines a more progressive world than our reality; it’s one of the reasons _Charlie’s Angels_ was so important to me,” she said of the noughties film trilogy in which she starred alongside Cameron Diaz and Drew Barrymore.
“As part of something so iconic, my character Alex Munday normalised Asian identity for a mainstream audience and made a piece of Americana a little more inclusive.”

Notes:
* El análisis simplón de O-ren Ishii como una mujere sexualizada resulta simplón, segun la actriz que lo actuó. 
* Es interesante que respondiera de una manera tan pública a alguien que deseaba encasillarla más que defenderla.
