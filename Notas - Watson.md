## The memeing of Mark Fisher

---


```ad-quote

This is in part as each one of these related yet idiosyncratic thinkers understood the horror of World War Two as somehow linked to the historical process of reification (the making into an object) of social and cultural relations in line with the tendency of capitalism to subjugate nature and humanity to the numerical count (and therefore to profit). Each saw this as a result of the project of the Enlightenment gone awry and suggested remedies by way of, respectively: artistic abstraction (Adorno); the association of constellations of objects and occurrences with which to interpret capitalism (Benjamin); a return to philosophizing (Horkheimer), and a freeing of eros via artistic expression (Marcuse).

Se relaciona un poco con lo de Wisexrack del club de la pelea de que todo debe de tener un propodito y al finall es iposible escapar del capitalismo, pues de todo necesitas ser bueno u obtener un beneficio.

Above all, this book addresses the central idea of Capitalist Realism, choosing to return throughout to that one book of Fisher’s, in part as it parallels so closely the Frankfurt School, in part as it has become an iconic meme. That central idea is that capitalism is responsible for mental illness, especially depression. We can see this today in light of the covid lockdowns that have disproportionately affected poor people who are already subject to mental health problems due to environmental, work, and dietary factors. Though, moreover, we see it in a collective stasis brought about by the lockdown in a physical sense, but going far beyond the lockdown itself. It is a kind of sickness of society: the psycho-sociological parallel to years — decades, even — of a depressive economic malaise affecting everyone from the middle class down (and even trapping the elite in the inertia of capital, as everyone is
ultimately beholden to the data economy).

Capitalismo realimo es la incapacidad para pensar fuera de la capacidad del capitalismo.

Namely, that the left matches the right’s claim that America be made great again through a focus on individual grit by emphasizing the individual role we can all play in fostering a society managed for the benefit of the many, not the few. This would rise to the challenge of building a sense of purpose for the left that meets the heroic narrative of the right, predicated on the idea of dispelling enemy hordes and individually embodying the fate of the nation or race. Against this, what could
be more heroic and necessary than having an individual role in creating the first society that is truly open to races and nations, while giving an opportunity for all to develop their talents through gainful employment? Sanders and Corbyn could even have doubled down on the idea of a bogeyman in the form of the super-rich, or the 1 per cent, as both Sanders and Corbyn did to some degree. 
Yet, however compelling the left narrative of a class of underdogs rising up, deposing their overlords, and founding the fairest society known to humankind is, it perennially fails to gain electoral votes.

The meme production of the Yang Gang is just one incarnation of “shitposting,” which is essentially the practice of producing lo-fi montage images to deliberately disparage or undermine a cause. The tendency in itself has become more of an aesthetic than a
political tactic, inspiring a descent into a trash visual culture whereby jokey, low resolution, and glitched productions are seen as inherently more valuable than the serious and polished output of the mainstream media.

El uso del shitposting como una practica política para desprestigiar un movimieto ha deja de ser una tactica politica para convertirse en una estetica.

La apropiación de simbolos debe de hacerse con cuidado para evitar confusiones.

Seen in this way the already sizable online left is no different to the bigger community of mostly female selfie producers who upload daily videos and pictures on TikTok and Instagram to generate attention and sponsorships for themselves, and clicks for the social media giants. Ultimately, internet corporations don’t care what you do, so long as you give them data — and the online left is simply one niche identity that achieves this. For young women uploading selfies, the internet plays on their insecurity at their own appearance. For young leftist meme producers of a similar age, social media companies play on threats made to their identity by right-wing imagery, or by leftists of other factions. None of this builds a coherent left-of-center movement, even if there is a growing communist, socialist, and anarchist presence online.

The lack of coherence within the online left is hardly surprising, given that the owners and shareholders of online social media apps, search engines, and shopping platforms are among the most powerful capitalists of all time. Indeed, we have to assume that the proliferation of online left content on major platforms such as YouTube and the streaming site Twitch is possible precisely because it is conducive to capitalism, a point that fits squarely within Mark Fisher’s observations in Capitalist Realism regarding the tendency of capitalism to incorporate and blunt the teeth of alternative movements.

La izquierda carece de un identidad fuerte en redes, a diferencia de la derecha que tien unos simbolos definidos.

Al internet dirigido por grandes compañias no le interesa que se forme una izquierda fuerte, le beneficia. Al final todo lo que no sea izquierda es algo que al final se integrará en el Capitalismo, según Fisher.

```ad-quote

The left internet has unfortunately become one assembly line in a vast factory of irritation in which the principal production unit is contrarianism, as seen in the above examples: You think you’re this (a never Trumper) but I’ll sell you this (MAGA hat); you think I represent this (QAnon), but actually, I’m this (anti-QAnon with QAnon characteristics); we are aiming at this (left communitarianism), but really we only achieve this (further division). And yet we still ask why the left is failing.
